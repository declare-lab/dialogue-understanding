On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .	Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?	We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .	I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?	Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .	It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .	Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .

There are many customers here .	Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity .	Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?	That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .	We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ?	That sounds good .	Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?	Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .	4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .	Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .	You mean to saya	It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?	We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .	All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .	Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .	Thank you for your help .

Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway .	No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success .	Why is that ?	Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money .	I agree , a man needs good career . But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too .

My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 .

Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots .

va_47	This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ?	Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan .	We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?	Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .	The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...	Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .	That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?	Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB .	What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .	Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !
va_48	Hi , my name is Tom .	Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda .	Nice to meet you too . Melinda .	Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department .	Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .	Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .	It looks like you guys work hard .	I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard . Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices .	Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .	Sure thing .
va_49	What do you think of our price ?	Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?	Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .	I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .	I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .	I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .	I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .	Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?	We've already cut down our price to cost level .	Is that all ?	Yes , this is the best we can do .	I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
va_50	So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?	It ' s great , dad . I don ' t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .	Even though you are only twelve , it ' s not too early to start saving a little money .	I ' Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ' t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?	You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .	But what if I need my money suddenly ?	The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .	Great ! So it ' s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !	Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ' t have to worry about that yet . Let ' s go make your first depot	OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .
va_51	Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ?	Yes , but you can't get there with out a change .	Which bus do I have to change ?	You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .	I see . Thank you .

va_54	Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?	Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .	Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?	Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .	Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?	All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .	Okay , that's good . I get it .
va_55	Kate , you never believe what's happened .	What do you mean ?	Masha and Hero are getting divorced .	You are kidding . What happened ?	Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .	That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?	Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .	That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?	Early in the New Year I guess .

va_57	Hello . Excuse me .	Yes . Can I help you ?	Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .	Of course I remember you .	I think I lost my wallet here .	Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .	Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?	No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?	Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor . Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?	No . It's been empty the whole time .	Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .	I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill . You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?	No . My friend did .	Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?	No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down . It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .	Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .	I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house . But what should I do ?	Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home . Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .	Should I call the police ?	You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .	Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .	I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .	Thanks for your help .

Do you think I could put info a transfer ?	Yes . But why should you want to do that ?	Do you mind if I speak frankly ?	Not at all . Go ahead .	Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?	Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did .
va_61	Where is that ?	Take me to the airport , please .	Are you in a hurry ?	I have to be there before 17 o'clock .	We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .	There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .	I'll do my best .	Here's twenty dollars .	Do you have small bills ?	No . If you can't break it , keep the change .

Even the TV has the limit .	Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?	Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !	That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?	Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !	OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ?

va_70	Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .	It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .	You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .	The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .	Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .	To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .	Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .	It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .	You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .	While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately	Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .	Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly .
va_71	Hello ?	Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .	What are you doing in Australia ?	I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?	Oh , right .

va_72	John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ?	I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .

va_76	What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !	I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .	I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !	I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?	I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .	Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?	I don't know .	I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .	What do you mean ?	We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .	I have plenty of gas .	Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .	So what can we do ?	Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .	Alright . That's a good idea .	I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .	Days ?	Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .	Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .	Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
va_77	Hey , buddy , can ' t you see there ' s a line ?	Oh , sorry . I didn ' t know .	What ? You haven ' t taken the bus before ?	No , I ' m afraid not .

You ' re welcome .
va_78	Can I help you ?	I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .	What kind of drink would you like with that ?	Just coke will be fine .	Would you like a super size meal ?

va_81	I would like to purchase some meat .	What kind of meat would you like to get today ?	First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .	A pound of ground beef is $ 2 . 48 .	That's perfect .

It's going to be $ 12 . 15 .	Okay , I think that will be all for me today .
va_82	I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .	Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .	Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .	Do you sell direct to shops ?	Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .	Do you keep a stock of these things ?	In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .	That is , your commission .	Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .	Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .	The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .	According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?	We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .	We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...	Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?	Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .	Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .	Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .	Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?	Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .	All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .	Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .
va_83	Excuse me , I ' m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company .	Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?	Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ' t arrived yet .	Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?
va_84	Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ?	Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .	Are the prices on the list firm offers ?	Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .	I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .	All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?	How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .	I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
va_85	Hello sir , may I help you ?	Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .	I see . Well , you have come to the right place .

We have this new ETC smart phone . It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are .	What about Wi-fi ?	Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home .	One last thing . Is it waterproof ?
va_86	We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !	Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !	Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?	I will ! I ' ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !	What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .	Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?	We ' re planning on having children soon , I don ' t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .	Fine ! Let ' s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !	I ' ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ' ll take it from there .	Yay !
va_87	Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?	Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ' t understand .	From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ' s overbooked .	I know what overbooked is , I just don ' t understand how that could happen ?	Actually it ' s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ' t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,	So who has to stay behind ?	Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .	Ok . I ' ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
va_88	I want to rent this apartment .	I ' m glad to hear that .	How much are you asking ?	You will have to pay $ 1050 every month .	I can ' t afford that .	What can you afford ?	I was thinking $ 800 a month .	I ' ll need you to pay more than that .	How much more ?	How does $ 900 every month sound to you ?	I can live with that .	We have a deal then .

Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start .

What are the working hours ?	40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day ..	Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ?	We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day .

This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?	Well , I don ' t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .	In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets .

This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ' s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .	Can any mp make a law ?	Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .	I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .	Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ' s . most mp ' s vote the way their party wants them to .	How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?	They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle

Did he want to know the reasons ?	Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .	That ' s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?	In a couple of days , I was told .	Wish you good luck !	Thank you .

va_170	Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ?	No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ?	Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant .	What was that like ?	It was always very busy there .	What did you do ?	I stood behind the register and took pizza orders .	Did you get any perks on the job ?	Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free .

va_172	Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ?	I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one .	Are you having any luck ?	Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .	Do you mind if I go with you ?	Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .	I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .	What happened ?	I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
va_173	Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?	Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ' s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ' m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ' ll look at something in a shop , but lat	No . I ' m a little worried about security . You never know who ' s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ' t you worry about that ?	Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ' t think it ' s the best way to sho	I ' m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .	I do . I ' m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ' t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .

va_175	Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?	Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .	But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .	More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .	Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ?	It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out .
va_176	Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ?	Just fill out an application .	Do I have to send an E-mail ?	You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit .	But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff .	Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website .	Can any unit see my information ?	It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .	Which websites offer this service ?	Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others .	Thank you .

Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?	Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .	What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?	I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
va_179	You want to argue your ticket today ?	Yes . That is why I'm here .	Tell me your argument .	I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .	Are you sure you weren't speeding ?	To be honest , I really wasn't .	What speed were you going ?	I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .	I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .	What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?	Don't worry about it .	I'm so glad for your help .
va_180	Annie , do you like shopping online ?	Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .	Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it .

Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . )	That's amazing . Oh , an on line virtual supermarket ?	Let's click to check it out .	Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets .

va_186	Are you ready to order ?	I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order .	Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp .	I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .	The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .	I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ?	You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad .	I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza .	That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree .	You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree .
va_187	I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me .	Are you sure you're using the right program ?	Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours .	That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file .

va_190	Wow ! What's the hold up ?	It ' s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer .	Really ? Then , I guess I won ' t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?	Actually , you might because there ' s a big convention in town this weekend .	I ' m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .
va_191	Hello , how can I help you today ?	I'd like to withdraw some money from my account .	Please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw .

Here's your money , 10,000 RIB . Please count it before you leave .	Yes , that seems to be all in order . Thanks very much .
va_192	Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers .	Do you have many different suppliers ?	Yes .

I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .	Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .	I have some medicine at home that I could take .	Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?	Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .	We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
va_195	Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ?	It ' s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us .
va_196	We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer .	Our price will be not less than $ 5000 .	Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ?	This is already our best price .	But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .	Well , what would you suggest ?	Could you make it $ 4500 ?	I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote .	Can we meet each other half way ?	What do you mean ?	Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ?	You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal .
va_197	I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch .	Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ?	My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 .	What kind of watch is it ?	It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch .	Yes , we have it .	Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ?
va_198	What are your thoughts on the apartment ?	I think that it ' s absolutely gorgeous .	There aren ' t any problems with the apartment ?	I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .	What problems ?	I did notice a few stains in the carpet .	We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .	You will ?	Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?	That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .	I ' m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .	It is . I love it .

Would you please have a look at this green one ?	OK . How much does it cost ?	It's 486 yuan .
va_200	Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?	As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .	Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .	So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .	The ball is in your court , Mrs . Wang . What price would you suggest ?	To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .	That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .	I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .	Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction .

va_203	We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight .	I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .	Have you got the time , Tom ?	Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !	But you bought it only last month .	Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .	How long will it take us to get there ?	I think about ten minutes by bus .	It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .	Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
va_204	Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ?	I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .	Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .	I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?	Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .	Ok .	Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?	Yes .	Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .	I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .	Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .	Ok , thanks doctor .

va_206	Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ?	Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .	Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?	I'm afraid so , yes .	Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?	Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .	What do you recommend we do ?	I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .	I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
va_207	Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .	You should go to the dentist .	I hate dentists .	Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .	It always hurts . I hate going .	Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .	O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .	Good . You'll feel better after you do .
va_208	Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .	Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .	How long does it take to get there ?	About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ' d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .	Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !	Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .	Great ! I ' ll take it .	Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !	I understand . Thank you very much !	Have a great trip .
va_209	I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .	A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?	The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .	So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?	It sounds like it will be .	I really hope it doesn't get cold .	That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .	The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .	That is true . The weather is constantly changing .	It would be nice if the weather would never change .	That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .	True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
va_210	Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .	If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .	Beneficial ? I don ' t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .	But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .	I doubt that .
va_211	Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?	Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .	You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .	What's special about these things ?	Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .	Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .
va_212	I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .	You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .	Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .	Is that so ?	Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .	Have you decided ?	Yes . I want to get a better job .	Could you tell me why you want to quit ?	I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .	Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?	I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .	OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .	Thank you so much for your advice .	And every best wish for your new job .	Thank you .
va_213	The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?	Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .	Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .	Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ' s nice that we ' Ve got a window seat .	Let's put our suitcases on the rack .	Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .	All right .
va_214	So , how should we get to the theatre ?	Let's take the bus .	I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .	It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .	It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .	We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .	Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .	If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?	We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .	I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .	Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .	It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .	Thanks , that was nice of you .	See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
va_215	Let's go over this plan again .	From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .	And that is mostly flat , right ?	Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .	And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?	That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .	It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .	Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?
va_216	Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?	I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .	I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .	Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .	No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .	All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .	Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .
va_217	It's time for bed .	I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .	It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .	I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .	Why don't you try counting sheep ?	I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .	That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .	Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?	If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .	I promise I'll go to sleep soon .	No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .	See you in the morning .
va_218	I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .	How about your psychological resilience ?	I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .	How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?	I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .	You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .	Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .	Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .	I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
va_219	Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you .	Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?	I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .	Fine . At 3:30 ?
va_220	I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David .	Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .	Oh , I remember now . Very nice to meet you again .	Nice meeting you , too .
va_221	I made my little brother cry .	Shame on you !
va_222	I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ?	Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .	Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?	We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?	Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .	I can help you with that .	Thank you .
va_223	Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?	Yes , we are on the same plane .	But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .	So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .	Yes . It ' s quite troublesome .	Why not go and find a porter ?
va_224	Billy , you don ' t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school .	But Mom ! Today we ' re playing football ! I love football !	You ' Ve got a fever and playing football isn ' t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ' s that on your arm ?	I don ' t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .	It ' s rash . I ' d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?	I bashed it against the chair in my room .	Does it hurt ?	A little , but not much .	Here .

Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .	Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .	I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .	OK , let's go .
va_232	Where on earth are we ?	Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .	What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?	I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .	Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .	It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .

I'm glad that you believe me .
va_237	Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?	Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .	Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .	That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .	What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?	Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .	So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?	Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .	Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .	After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
va_238	what shall we do after the volleyball match ?	how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .	that's a good idea .

Do you know how much they are ?	the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .	oh , I see .

All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .	any other ideas ?	there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .	it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .

No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .	But I don ' t like them ! It ' s not fair !	You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .	Ok ... actually , I don ' t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .	I ' ll remember that for next time . You ' ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?	Thanks mom !

I think so . I used to be an interpreter .	Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?	The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .

Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .	Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?

va_253	Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .	OK , what does that entail ?	It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .	Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?	Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .	I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?	Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .	Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .

Have you any reliable evidence ?	Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally	Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ' ll send our technicians to repair them .	Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .	I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .	All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you .
va_286	Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .	Oh where was that ?	I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .	Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .	Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ?	She will be 86 next month .	That is truly amazing !
va_287	Did you punch in ?	Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !	Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it .	Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?	Sure , when those never ending meetings .
va_288	I don't think you've met my sister , Mary .	No , I haven't had the pleasure .	Come and meet her now .	All right .
va_289	Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way .	Did you have hotel card or something ?	Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here .	Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .	I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ?
va_290	The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?	I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ' m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .	So , let ' s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ' Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ' t they ?	Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ' t need to be replaced .	How long did it take you to do the tiling .	As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .	I think you ' Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?	You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
va_291	I'd like to see that pen , please .	You mean this one ?	No , the other one in the brown case .	Oh , this one ... Here .	May I try it ?	Sure .	It's very smooth . I'll take it .	Cash or charge ?	Charge , please .
va_292	I ' Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .	We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .	Why , your price has soared . It ' s almost 25 % higher than last year ' s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .	I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .	I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources .	But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .	I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years .	There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .	Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose .

How much do are you looking to spend ?	I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .	Looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .	It doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .	Anything you need to have in the place ?	I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .	You can also check out university bulletin boards .	Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?	Not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .	Thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .	Good luck .

I'm impressed . Good for you !

It is the basement for the future cooperation .	That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item .

Can I open the packages to check the color and style ?	Of course , let me help you .	The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great !	You know , we are superior to other clothes companies .	Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons .	OK . We will manage it later .

va_339	I ' ll need to meet with you before you go on vacation , Alex . I have a few things to clear up .	I ' ll be glad to . But my schedule is super tight this week . I think the only time I have free is at lunch on Wednesday .	That ' s fine . I can make that .	All right , then . I ' ll see you at noon on Wednesday .
va_340	I've got a temperature and my stomach hurts .	How long have you been feeling this way ?	It all started the day before yesterday .	You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .	What should I do ?	Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out .
va_341	What would you like to eat tonight ?	I'm not sure , what about you ?	Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ?	Sure sounds good to me .
va_342	Did you clean your room today ?	No , not yet .	Well , when were you planning on doing that ?	I'm going to clean it up later .	Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier ?	I'm going to clean it .	I want you to vacuum in your room , and don't forget to dust everything .	I know . I'll do it .	Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else .	I'm not going anywhere until later , so I'll clean it then .
va_343	Hello , can I help ?	I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C .	I have it right here .	Great . Can I take it with me now ?

va_344	Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ?	What do you need ?	I need to talk to you about that new driver you ' Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him .	He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
va_345	I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !	Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .	He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .	I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .	I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .	Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .	Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .	Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .	I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?	I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .
va_346	hey , you look great ! how's everything ?	yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .	really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .	it's important to do proper exercises .	you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .	the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .	sounds reasonable .	we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .	and fruits !	surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .	I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?	yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .	I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .	you bet it !
va_347	Staying out all night , you frightened me to death .	I stayed with my friends .	You should at least give me a call .	I'm sorry , Mum .
va_348	Did anyone call ?	Just Mr . White .	What did he want ?	He wouldn't say over the phone .
va_349	What kind of job do you intend to do ?	I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history .	What are your plans if you were hired ?	I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .
va_350	You stepped on my foot !	Sorry . I didn't mean to .
va_351	what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?	while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .	why not ?	the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !	it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .	I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .	I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .	all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .	perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .	I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .	that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .	you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
va_352	Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ?	This is he . Who ' s calling , please ?	This is Chris Emerson speaking .	Hello , Chris . How can I help you ?
va_353	Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ?	Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted .

Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .

va_360	Where can I call a taxi ?	There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate .
va_361	How did your company's fundraiser go ?	The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .	So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ?	Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .	Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .	In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .

Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA .	Have you ever been a student cadre ?	Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class .	Did it affect you much ?	It ' s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike .	In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ?

Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?	For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .	Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?	No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy	If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?	That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have .

va_396	Ok , let ' s go through this one more time . I don ' t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !	I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .	Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .	So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?	Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .	Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ' s all set right ?	No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .	You know what ? I ' ll just have everything dry cleaned .

va_403	I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement .	Good , if you ' ll excuse me , I ' ll go over the sheet right now .	Take your time .	I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .	I ' m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .	We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ' s reasonable , isn ' t it ?	Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ' ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .	The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ' s settle that matter first .	Well , as I ' Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ' re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .	When I say your prices are much too high , I don ' t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .	How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?	To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .	Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?	I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ' s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?	Very well , I will .
va_404	Excuse me , you look lost . Can I help you ?	Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .	Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .	Right ? OK , got it .	Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?	Next left then right ? OK .
va_405	I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .	I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '	I'm trying to find a post office .	Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .	Should I take the bus ?	No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .	Thank you very much .	Anytime .
va_406	It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature .	Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background .	Yes .	But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .	So you must be an extravert ?	Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .	What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?	A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .	Don't you consider it a hard work ?	Hard but interesting , I think .	Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?	Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .	Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?	Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
va_407	Didn ' t you punch in this morning , Monica ?	Sorry , I don ' t know the rule about punching .	That ' s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule .	Do we also need to punch out after work ?	According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ' clock and punch out after 5 o ' clock every work day .	How about the lunch break , Lucy ?	From 11 thirty to 1 o ' clock .	May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?	Sometimes , but not quite often .
va_408	This needs dry-cleaning . Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ?	Let me see . We ' ll try , but I ' m not sure that we can remove it .	Ok , then . We ' ll I ' d also like to have this pressed .	Any starch ?	No starch .
va_409	What's the problem ?	I have a laceration on my left forearm .	Let me have a look . How did this happen ?	I got hit by a car in an accident .	Was there much bleeding afterward ?	No , not much .	Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?	Will I need stitches ?	Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ?	No , not really .	You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long .	Thank you , doctor . Bye .
va_410	What time is it ?	Ten to nine .	Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty .	Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?	What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?	I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking . It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?	You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late .	You only care about your work .	Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .	Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?	OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ?	Yes .	I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina .	Thank you .
va_411	Canton Hotel .	I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson .	A double room for the 12th ? The name is Wilson ?	Yes , that's right .

va_412	How is the result of your lab test ?	When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .	Then say it .	When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .	That ' s just what I want to know .	He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me .
va_413	Could you tell me something about your family ?	OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I .	Are your brother and sister still in school ?	My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .	What does your father do ?	My father is a middle school teacher .	What about your mother ?	My mother is a housewife .	Are you married ?	I am not married yet and I live alone now .	Do you need to support your family ?	No , my father and brother are doing that .	Have you finished school ?	Yes , I have already graduated .
va_414	I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !	I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .	This is too good to be true .	And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?	Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .	It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?	We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors .
va_415	How's your new car ?	Perfect ! Couldn't be better .	You made a good choice , then ?	It's just what I want .	No regrets ?	I am really pleased with it .	I am glad you are happy .	It's super .
va_416	Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ?	Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?	Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .	Is there any flexibility on that ?	Unfortunately , not .	OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .	Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .
va_417	Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you .	All right . Please read it to me .	On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation .

va_418	Hi , I would like to return this TV .	Sure , do you have the receipt ?	Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .	Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?	The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .	I see , and what about the keyboard ?	I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .	I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .	Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
va_419	There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out !	Luckily we got the last two .	Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !	Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .	I really admire those who made such great inventions !	May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .	They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .	Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .	Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .	Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .	No , quite the contrary .	Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?	Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .	Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .
va_420	What can I do for you ?	I need some medicine .	For whom ?	My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .	What symptoms does she have ?	Fever and a bad cough .	I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .	What kind of medicine does she need ?	Patulin will be enough .	How many pills for each time ?	Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .	Thank you very much .	It's my pleasure .
va_421	Do you believe in god ?	Not at all . I ' m an agnostic . do you ?	I ' m not sure . Why don ' t you believe there is a god ?	I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .	I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ' t explained yet .	I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .	For example ?	Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .	Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
va_422	Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ?	They're going skiing in Colorado .	What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !	You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .
va_423	What a terrible house !	I'm sick of it , too .	The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .	It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .	Sure .

That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?	Do you have any special request ?	I'd like to see some traditional arts .	So that means you are shopping for presents ?	Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .	Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .	Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .	I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .	You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .	As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .	Wow , you are the expert on it .
va_432	Operator . Can I help you ?	I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang .	To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ?

va_434	Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days .	That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?	Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .	That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?	The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .	Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .	Thank you , Mr . Black .

va_435	Did you ever get a parking ticket ?	Only a few .	What's a few ?	I've gotten six , I think .	Did you pay your fines ?	Of course I have .	How much are the parking tickets ?	I think they're $ 130 .	That's expensive .	I just got a parking ticket .	You should probably pay the fine soon .	I'm going to pay it today .

Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?	No , I ' d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .	All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .	Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .	Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?	Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .	You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?	Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .
va_437	You're finally here ! What took so long ?	I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .	It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .	I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .	perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .	I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .	It would be better for the environment , too .	I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .	Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .	The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .	Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .	That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !	So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?	Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .
va_438	That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .	I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .	That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .	Sure , for at least three thousand per month .	That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .	I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
va_439	Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday . Aren ' t they ready ?	They'll be ready by this afternoon .	Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .	Is that right ? We're very sorry .	I thought it was " the same day " service . Anyway , please do hurry .	I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .	Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?	Yes , we'll do so .
va_440	Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ?	I want to effect payment under an L / C today .	No problem . OK ... just checking for you .

Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?	That's fine , thank you .
va_443	Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue .

va_444	It seems that many boys are fighting there .	Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .
va_445	the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !	exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .	on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .	as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .	I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse	what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?	it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .	I see , so it's similar to global warming ?	they're related to one another , yes .	I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .	people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .	people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .	I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
va_446	Would you like some cookies ? I just made them .	Thank you . Yes , I would .	These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored .	I guess I'll try a chocolate one first . Mmmm ... this is delicious . Are they hard to make ?	No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here . See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .	That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight .
va_447	Can I help you ?	I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .	Hold on , plese . It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow . The price is $ 110 .	Well , I want to stay under $ 100 .	I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons . The price is the same .
va_448	How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?	It ' s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .	Oh yes . I ' Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .	You really shouldn ' t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .	Ok , I ' Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ' t I ?	Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .	I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?	That ' s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .	These machines aren ' t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .

You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ' d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .	Thanks a lot . What I ' ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .	That ' s fine . You shouldn ' t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .

Moreover , both my spoken and written English are pretty good .	Well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , Those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year .	I think I ' m qualified for the job if I can be given the chance . While at school , I once worked as part-time translator in a company and salesperson with a textile company for two years . And I don't mind being paid less from the start , I just want to enrich my experience and competence .	Good . That is the kind of man we are looking for . By the way , do you like traveling ?

You know , I ' m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .	I don ' t know about that . with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ' t know if you ' re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ' s just too much instability . I wouldn ' t feel comfortable investing in this climate .	But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ' m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example . they have 1 . 4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .	Come on , son , you ' re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .	Fine , then ! If that ' s the way you feel , so be it . But you ' re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ' m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .

And how about the working hours ?	Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .	Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ' s not really a shock for me .	Good , as long as you understand that .	And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?	Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .	That sounds ideal .
va_543	Smells good ! What ' s for breakfast ?	Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !	Nice ! Brunch !	Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !	Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?	Yeah , just the way you like it !

I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .	Well , only you liked it really , darling .	Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .
va_582	Hi , Bob , everything okay ?	More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .	Oh ? What's that ?	Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .	What gift ?	It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .	You refused the gift ? That's terrible .	I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .	Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .	That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
va_583	I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet .	We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .	Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ?	You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .	Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ?	The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .	Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ?	The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .	Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .	Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .
va_584	Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application .	OK . Here is my application form and all the documents .	Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ?

va_585	What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ?	Dear friends .

In this way , we will know each other better .	Definitely ! Thank you !
va_586	I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you .	I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ?	I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions .	How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?	We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .	Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?	It doesn ' t matter , as we do not have any children .	Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?	In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .	Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
va_587	Waiter .	Would you like anything else ?	No , thanks . Please bring us the bill .	All right . And do you want to separate bills or just one single bill ?	Separate bills , please .	Here is your bill . It comes to 80 yuan . And yours is 60 yuan .	Here you are . Thank you

va_589	What are the attractions of that city ?	It's famous for beautiful countryside with clean air .	Oh , that's what I am looking for . Do you have a reduction for 6 persons ?	Yes , sir . We offer a 10 % discount for groups more than 5 .
va_590	I would like to order a waistcoat .	Have you chosen the material ?	Yes , I want it to made of tweed .	Fine . And the charge is $ 100 .	When will it be available ?	Next Wednesday .
va_591	Hi , I'm George . I'll be your waiter this evening . Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ?	I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .	And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .	I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .	Can I get you anything to drink ?	Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .	Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .	Thank you .
va_592	What is your salary at present ?	My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year .	What are your salary expectations now ?	I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .	That's a little more than we had planned .	I think you'll find I'm worth that .	I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?	Yes , it is quite reasonable .
va_593	Excuse me . I've been waiting for my main dish for quite a time .	Yes , sir . Just a minute , please , I'll check with the kitchen .	Thank you for waiting . It takes another ten to fifteen minutes , I'm afraid .	We have an appointment in half an hour .	I see .	Do you have anything else I can have instead ?	Well , yes . How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once .	I'll take beef stew , then .
va_594	Hi , Sally ! You are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl !	Congratulations , Bob ! That ' s great news , what ' s her name ?	We ' Ve named her Alice after my wife ' s grandmother .	That ' s a pretty name . Give your wife my best !
va_595	Excuse me , can you tell me where is the taxi stand ?	You can find one at the end of the street .	Are there any signs there ?	No . but there are quite many cars .	Thank you .
va_596	Would Dr . Black be able to see me at 9:00 a . m . tomorrow ?	I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation .	Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ?	Yes , she's free then .
va_597	Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .	You should go to the dentist .	I hate dentists .	Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .	It always hurts . I hate going .	Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .	O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .	Good . You feel better after you do .
va_598	Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ?	Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ?	Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ...	Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .	You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?	Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it .	Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great .	But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .	Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them .
va_599	I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet .	I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ?	Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it .	Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into . We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason .
va_600	I really want to make something for dinner .	What are you going to cook ?	I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make .	A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .	I don't know how to make that .	All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .	That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?	The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .	What's next ?	Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .	What's the next thing I need to do ?	Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
va_601	How do I submit an expense report ?	You need all your receipts for reimbursement .	You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?	Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ' ll get it signed for you .
va_602	Good morning !	Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ?	Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged .	Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?	I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .	How long do you think she'll be ?	I really can't say how long she'll be .	Can I leave a message , please ?	Yes , certainly .	Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?	Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .	Thank you very much .
va_603	Excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? A friend of mine will join us .	Wait a moment . Here you are .	By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .	Sure .
va_604	Can you help me out , Chuck ?	Sure . What's it , Yvonne ?	I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .	Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .
va_605	Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ?	Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card .	What seems to be the problem ?	I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .	Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?	No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !	You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?	Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?	Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .	Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
va_606	Can you manage chopsticks ?	Why not ? See .	Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?	Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .	What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .	According to some studies it may cause cancer .	Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .	I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .	I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons .
va_607	Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?	It was a nightmare .	What ' s up ?	Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .	Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?	Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .	This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?	I am still waiting for their call .	Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
va_608	Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?	Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?	Yes . Would you like a window seat ?	If one's available , please . But not over the wing .
va_609	morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ?	Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .	Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?	Let me check ... His flight ' s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .
va_610	I'm calling today about a bill that I never received .	Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?	It was for my Master Card .	You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .	I haven't got it in the mail yet .	The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .	What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?	Maybe you should call your post office .	But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?	Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .	Okay , thank you very much for your help .	Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .
va_611	Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ?	Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .	Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .	What a shame that we can't take pictures .
va_612	OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ?	I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?	Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !	I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .	Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "	I'll put the song at the front of the list .
va_613	Here is the document you asked for this morning .	Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .	You ' re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .	This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?	The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .	Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
va_614	How are you doing , Jim ?	Fine , just fine . How about you ?	Not too bad .
va_615	I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job .	Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .
va_616	What's for lunch ?	Pork chops .
va_617	What happened to you ?	I think I caught a cold .	Do you have any symptoms ?	Runny nose and coughing .	Do you have a fever ?	I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so .	It's not serious .	Are you sure ?	Yes .	What should I do ?	You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise .
va_618	What kind of place shall we rent ?	It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .	Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .	Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .	I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .	Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .	Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .	How much do you think the rent will be ?	I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
va_619	I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon .	Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?	The earliest we can do is by the end of June .
va_620	Did you have any working experience during college ?	Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model .	What did you learn from your part-time jobs ?	I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
va_621	Smells good ! What ' s for breakfast ?	Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !	Nice ! Brunch !	Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !	Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?	Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .	Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .	Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !
va_622	Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ?	Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .	So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?	Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
va_623	Hello . Hot water overflowed from the bathtub . Will you help me ?	Would you turn off the tap ?	I did it .	Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?	OK . I will .	I'll have our housekeeper come right away .	I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .	When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .	Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
va_624	Would you like some more coffee ?	No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .	The waitress is bringing the bill right now .	This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?	Yes , this waitress did a great job .	OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36 . 00 .	What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?	Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?	Yes , 20 % would be perfect .	Her tip will end up being $ 7 . 20 plus the bill of $ 36 . 00 . The total will be $ 43 . 20 .	Yes , that was one fantastic meal !	I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .
va_625	It ' s time for me to go now .	Would you like me to go with you ?	I ' d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .	Do you want to type that letter ?	I ' d rather you typed it .	Do you want to tell her ?	I ' d rather you told her .
va_626	Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head .	What crime did I commit ?	You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ' Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ?	I am innocent .
va_627	Would you like to come by and play bridge ?	Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .	Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .	Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .	Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?	Well , do you have any suggestions ?	Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?	It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .	Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .	OK .	Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
va_628	Tom , it's time for you to go to bed .	Good night , mum .	Good night .
va_629	Operator . May I help you ?	Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?	Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .	No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .
va_630	What's our target audience for this campaign ?	This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .	Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?	Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .	Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?	Demographics say an average age of 28 . 7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
va_631	John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute .	Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .	John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion .	Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .	Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it .	Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .	You've earned it .
va_632	How can I help you today ?	I am returning something that I bought yesterday .	What would you like to return ?	I'm returning a cellphone .	Was there something wrong with it ?	It's defective .	What isn't working on it ?	It keeps turning off on it's own .	Alright , do you have the receipt ?	I have it right here .	I'm going to take care of this and refund your money .	Thanks for your help .
va_633	I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .	Dear , let ' s drop the subject .
va_634	Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?	Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .	Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ?	What about the driving license ?	Don't you have any other identification ?	I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .	Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?	Thank you . Here you are .	How do you want your money ?	Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?	All right . Please wait for a moment .
va_635	Could you fill in this form , please ?	All right .	Have you got any identification ?	Yes , here's my ID card .
va_636	Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !	What ? What did you buy ?	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !	What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?	There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .	And ?	So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .	And it's a brick ?	Yes .	I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?	I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .	So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .	Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .	But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .	Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !	C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .	That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .	You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?
va_637	Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?	Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ' m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .	Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .	Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ' t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ' s the peace sign .	Wow , Arthur ! You ' re as blind as a bat !	Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .	Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .	Thanks doc !	Arthur , that ' s the bathroom .
va_638	Would you like some more coffee ?	No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .	Good luck finding the waitress !	The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?	I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .	Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .	So the total is $ 36 . 00 for our dinner .	How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?	I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .	I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .	I think that we should leave 10 % .	$ 3 . 60 will be the right amount for the tip .
va_639	I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th .	Let me see what's available .	By the way , I'd prefer a night flight .	Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .	That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money .
va_640	How much was your watch ?	Take a guess .
va_641	A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too .	Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?	Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .	Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .	But I'm going on a business trip in two days !	Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .
va_642	Would you care for a drink ?	No , thanks . I'm fine .
va_643	Let's go practice your driving .	If that's what you want to do , then we can .	Did you buckle your seatbelt ?	I'm buckled up . What's next ?	You need to start the car now .	What do you want me to do ?	Go left .	How far should I go ?	I'll let you know when I want you to stop .	Tell me before you want me to stop .	All right , try parking here .	Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .
va_644	How may I help you ?	I ' m making a deposit today .	Cash or check ?	I would like to deposit a check .	You need to sign the back .	Okay . Here you go .	Would you like cash back ?	Yes , I would .	How much ?	Let me get $ 150 back .	Here you go .	Thank you . Have a good one .
va_645	I'd like to extend my visa for another two years .	Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?	Student visa .	What is the reason for extension ?	I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ' s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .

va_647	Come in , Arnold . Have a seat .	Good morning .	Would you like something to drink ?	No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .	So , you're a serious coffee drinker .	Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .	Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing . Everyone has to have something . For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?	No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .	Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?	I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .	I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .	It is about the staff meetings . You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .	Yes .	Well , I have been thinking about it . And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .	What do you suggest ?	The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week . We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .	You mean because people have to go across town to get here .	Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .	That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .	I think they are important too . That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .	I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .	Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .	Well .	I also think the meetings should be more focused . And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .	You mean you want to run the meetings ?	No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .	Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .	I really think it would work . The meetings could be longer , and better organized .	I am not against the idea , Arnold . It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do . Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .	Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .	I will call the managers . Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "

No , and I don ' t usually get a lot of stomachaches .	We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .	I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this .

There are four more stops .	Oh , my God !	What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !	Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?	No , not on the train , but in the station .	Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?	Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ?	Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible .	I guess you'll never forget today .

You're kidding !	No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .	You could have called .	I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .	You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?	Guess where we ended up .	I don't know . Where ?	When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .	Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?	I don't know . The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .	Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .	I know it is . I don't know how it happened .	Hmm , maybe I do .	What ?	Maybe I have an idea how it happened .	How ?	You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .	Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
va_664	Won't you have some of this ?	Yes , thanks .	It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .	It's very good . How do you make it ?	I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .	This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .	I'm glad you like it .	You Americans usually have nutritious food .	Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?	We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .	I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night .

Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ' t stop studying and creating .

va_673	Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough .	I think my husband has some .	Are you sure he ' s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ' t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you .	That ' s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ' s education . I can ' t afford that by myself .

Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight .	I have to admit it's easier said than done .	Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health .	But you know I'm just not into exercises .

va_691	Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?	Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ' s dress code .	Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt .	Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .

My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .	OK .
va_695	Oh , damn . There ' s another traffic jam on the highway .	How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?	There are just too many people , and too many cars .	I wonder if there was an accident .	No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .	Well , let ' s put on some music . We ' re going to be stuck in this for a while .	All right , what do you want to listen to ?	How about some Beatles ?	Yeah , all right .

va_703	Hi , John .	Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?	Oh , no problem .	Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?	Six months .	Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .	Well , one year would be fine , too . I ' m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .

You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .	It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .	But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .	I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .

It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?	All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?	It looks good . But can I try it on ?	Of course . Let me help you .	Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?	$ 280 .	Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .
va_779	Mike , you're seventeen years old , right ?	Yeah , Why ?	You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen .	You can bet on that .
va_780	Come in and sit down .	Thanks , Mr . Liang .	Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .	Really ? I am too happy .	I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .	Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .	You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .	Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
va_781	Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice .	Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you .	So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?	Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ?	Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .	Oh . Jack , I have missed your sense of humor . Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do . It ' s your gift .	Or a curse .	Nope , it's a gift . Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .	That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .	Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?	Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off .	You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?	I could , but where's the fun in that ?
va_782	Hi . I ' m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay . How long of a delay is expected ?	So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .	Do you think it ' s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?	I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?	What seems to be the problem ?	It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .	Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat .
va_783	I need to go to the ATM .	So , why don ' t you ?	I have no idea how to use the ATM .	What do you mean ?	This will be my first time using an ATM .	I can help you with that .	Explain to me how to use it .	Just put your card into the machine .	Now what do I do ?	Then you need to type in your PIN .	Now what ?	Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ' s it .
va_784	Would you like something to drink ?	Yes please . Do you have any teas ?	Of course we have lots of teas ?	What do you recommend ?	What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?	What ' s this one ?	That ' s Oolong tea -- it ' s a Cantonese tea .	Ok , I ' ll try that .
va_785	May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?	Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !	Why are they all in glass boxes ?	For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .	So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?	No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .	I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?	Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .	Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .	The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !	Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?	Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .	Oh , it does ?
va_786	I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now !	I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .
va_787	What would you like on your pizzas ?	We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni .	Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1 . 50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke .	No , thanks .	All right . That'll be $ 12 . 50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes .	Thanks .
va_788	We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things .	Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .	Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .	Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
va_789	Can you tell me the way to library ?	Sure , turn left at the next crossing .	Is it on Xinhua street ?	Yes . You can't miss it .
va_790	Comfort Inn , may I help you ?	I ' m looking for a hotel near the convention center .	You ' re in luck ! We ' re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?	Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?	During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ' Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now -- only $ 30 a night . And we ' Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in	That ' s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .	Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking	That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?	I ' m sorry , sir , we don ' t . But we do accept all major credit cards .
va_791	I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room .	Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?	It's . I think , neighbours on the right .	You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?	I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .	All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .	If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
va_792	Have you ever been to Xi ' an ?	Yes , I ' Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .	I ' Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ' t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .	I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .	Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?	Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .
va_793	A ticket to London , please .	A cheap day return ticket ?	Yes , including London Tube .	That'll be twelve pounds .
va_794	Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ?	Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .	It is very confusing to know what to eat .	You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains .	Are there certain things that I should avoid ?	You shouldn ' t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food .	After watching my diet , what else should I do ?	You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day .	Can I have a glass of wine now and then ?	As long as you don ' t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .
va_795	Darling , I am back . What are you doing ?	I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )	B , should we get a maid ?	I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid .	You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .	We really don't need to .

va_800	Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner .	Okay , Bob , when will I see you ?	Maybe I will be around later .	Okay , I'll see you later .

va_802	Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .	It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .	Yes , I need to refill it today .	Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .	I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .	Well , it looks like you have . You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .	Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out . Can you just refill it once more ?	I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription . And this prescription has run out .	But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .	Miss , I understand your problem . But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it . We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .	But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .	A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law . You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .	Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor . It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .	Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens . But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .	This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .	Maybe that's true . I don't know . But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
va_803	What are you doing ?	I ' m trying to put the vase on the shelf .	Let regive you a hand .	No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .
va_804	There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .	Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .	I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound .	Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .	That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .	Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
va_805	Ahhchooo !	You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?	No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .	I never have seasonal allergies .	Consider yourself lucky .	What are all the symptoms ?	Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .	That doesn't sound good .	No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?	Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .	Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .	I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .	That's pretty bad .	But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
va_806	Let's have a look at the map first .	All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .	Let's buy some tickets .	The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train	Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?	No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
va_807	What do you do ?	I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .
va_808	I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?	Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .	Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .	What about cats ? They are more independent .	Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .	How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?	Yeah , are they easy to look after ?	Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
va_809	Can I be of any service to you ?	I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?	There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop . For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few . Do you have anything in mind ?	No , not really . But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .	I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik . They are very easy to carry .	So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
va_810	Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?	I had some bread for breakfast .	Let's go out for brunch .	Brunch ?	It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .	Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .

va_812	Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ?	Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine .	They are both spicy hot , I've heard .	That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .	They might be too hot for me .	Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .	What about any special Beijing dishes ?	There's the Beijing roast duck .	Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?	You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant .	Is it near here ?	Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean .	Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ?	Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver .	That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
va_813	hi , Isaiah . How are you ?	I ' m well . And you ?	fine . How ' s your job going ?	I don ' t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business .	really ? That ' s fantastic .

I ' Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs .	how ' s it going ?	it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming !	that ' s such great news . I ' m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ?	our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ' re planning on opening up two more offices soon .	where will those be located ?	if all goes well , we ' ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October .	when will you find out ?	we ' re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .	well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !	thanks !
va_814	Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ?	Pretty well . What about you ?	Fine . Where are the other guys ?	It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .	Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ?	Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?	Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .	Did you go to a real estate agent ?	No , that will be too expensive .	That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?	My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .	Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .	I'll appreciate it so much .
va_815	Good afternoon .	My goodness ! It ' s the afternoon ? Doesn ' t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .	Thank you .	What ' s the time ? My watch has stopped .	It ' s half past twelve .

They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends .	That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number .	Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ?	Yeah , that would be great . Thanks .	No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days .	Thanks million .	My pleasure .
va_817	There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ?	Use them from the outside in .	I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .	Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?	Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .	Let's look at our menus .	Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .	Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
va_818	It was nice talking to you .	Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?	I really have to go .	Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .	I have things to do .	Like what ?	Don't be nosey .	I'm not . I just want to know .	Well , it's really none of your business .	That's harsh .	I'm sorry , but I have to go .	Fine .
va_819	Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?	Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation .
va_820	Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ' t you ?	Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?	Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .	And must I go back to school ?	No , you needn ' t do that . You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .	But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ' m nearly 17 .	You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .	What else I ' Ve got to do ? Join the army ?	Who knows ! That might come to later .
va_821	How do you do ?	How do you do ?	My name is Wang Liang , I ' m from Beijing . Where do you come from ?	I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province .	You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing .	Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ?	Just over 4 years now .

I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .	I know you are keen on photography .

I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?	Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ' t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .	How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?	I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .

Well as you can see from the resume I ' m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen .

Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .	That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?	I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .

I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !	if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .	what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?	he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .	they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .	that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .	I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !	regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .	I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .	let's hope so .

That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .	Is that why you stiffed the waiter ?	You got it . All right , Let's go back to school .
va_863	Good morning , sir .	Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .	Do you have a particular style in mind ?	The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .	I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .	I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .	The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?	Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?	Next Friday .	Thank you .

va_867	Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ?	Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .	Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?	We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .	That's not a problem .

But we've just been too busy to look for a house .	We need to find a good realtor .	Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .	What do you mean ?	Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .	But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .	Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .	I still think we should have a realtor . We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has	Of course we need a home inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .	So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?	It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .	And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?	Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .	Why ?	Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .	Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .	It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .	I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .	Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .
va_869	I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening . My wife is terribly ill .	Sorry to hear that .	How about next week ?	Fine , we'll be expecting you then .

va_873	Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ?	Sure , but I have to finish this report first .	Never mind . I'll do it .
va_874	Are you interested in mountaineering ?	Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you	I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .	How did you spend the night there ?	We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .	I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .	Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?	Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .	I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?	I'd love to .

She's very forgetful !	Ah ! She has a bad memory . How old is she ?	She's eighty-seven .	I suggest you take this book . It ' s very exciting .	Thank you . That ' s a good idea . she likes exciting books . Can you suggest another one ?
va_880	Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?	Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .	Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .	I know , I know . But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !	Really ? What's the series about ?	Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .	It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .	I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .	Really ? that's interesting !	Yeah . Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .	OK , I'll give it a go .
va_881	Hello , hot water overflowed from the bathtub . Would you help me ?	Would you turn off the tap ?	I did it .	Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .	Ok , I will .

va_884	So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...	We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...	That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .

Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time .

Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ' t want to start a brain drain , I ' m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ?	Great ! It ' s a deal ! Thank you , sir !	Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?	Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company !

What's so interesting about it ?	Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !	What ? How did that happen ?	They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .	Wow . What does his look like now ?	It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .	What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?	He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .	What's he going to do now ?

va_950	Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?	I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .	Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?	Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .	So this would be your first automobile ?	That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .	Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .	Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .	So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !	Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .	Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .	I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .	Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?	Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .	I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .
