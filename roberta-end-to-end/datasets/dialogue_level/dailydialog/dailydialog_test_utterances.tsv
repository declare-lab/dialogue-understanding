See , here , there ' s water leaking everywhere !	I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ' s why it won ' t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ' s not working either . I suspect that there ' s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ' s causing a blockage . That ' s what ' s making your toilet overflow .	Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are .	Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ' t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ' s urgent .	That would be great ! Is it expensive ?	Let ' s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars .

Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .	I could have Suzy stay at my place .	I don't want to do that to you , Karen .	Why not ?	Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .	I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .	I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .	I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .	I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother .

te_63	Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?	Sure . First of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .	Yeah , that's very important .	So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .	I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .	That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .	It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .	It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .	But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .	I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .	It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .	You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .	I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .	You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .	It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .	It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .
te_64	The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?	No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .	It better be more than last year .	Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .

After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client .

te_139	Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract .

If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .	Thank you .	Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .	That's a good idea .	First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .	Agreed .	For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments .	I understand your position .

Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .	That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .	That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .	I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ?	Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?	All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .	Very well . Thank you .

But if I don't pass , will you call me ?	I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .	Then do I have the chance to get this job ?	I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers .	I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation .	Your mentality is very good and that's great .	Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .	My pleasure .

In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .

te_153	You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?	Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful .	So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?	Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .	Do you do the same exercises every day ?	No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .	Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?	It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping .

We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home .	I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .

But , that ' s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable .	I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ' d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .	All right , Maria . I ' ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ' ll have to re-do it .

Sounds like it was a close game .	That's the reason it was such a great game .	The next game , I will definitely be there .
te_208	Have you ever tried shopping online ?	No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .	That's right . Seeing is believing .	I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .	That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .	What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .	It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .	I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .	Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .	That's a good idea .

Yes , at the end of the hall .

Could you start the ball rolling ?	Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .	Well , that's kind of obvious .	Give me a break , Mr Yang .

te_214	I ' m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ' t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !	No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ' s hear more about these chocolates you ' re offering .	Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ' re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .	Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?	Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .	Really ? I didn ' t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production	That ' s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ' Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !	Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...	Unique , aren ' t they ? I bet you ' Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ' s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .	Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ' s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?	I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ' m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis .	Haggis ? What ' s Haggis ?	It ' s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ' s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ' s stomach .	Ah , get back to you .	Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ?
te_215	Do you need a guide ?	Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ?	It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .	That's reasonable .
te_216	Aren't you Jim Green ?	Yes , that's right .	I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor .	Oh , yes . I remember .
te_217	Lucy , I ' d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?	Monica , wait a moment . I think we ' d better call the repair man to do it .	I think I can handle it by myself .	I ' d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .	I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ' t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .	Other company rules also need your attention .	Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . Yeah , thank you for telling me .	Don ' t mention it .
te_218	Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever !	When did you finish ?	This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches !	Well , I ' m glad to hear it . Have a cup of coffee !
te_219	I didn ' t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why .	Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ?	I am afraid that I forgot to send it in .	We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks .	Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ?	It can ' t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .	I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .	You can ' t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !	Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ?	Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time .
te_220	I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes .	I'm ready when you are , sir .	Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York .	You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine .	I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ?	Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .	A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ?	I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely .	Okay . Let me think about this .	Okay , sir . But don't take too long . You only have 30 minutes .
te_221	May I take your order ?	Yes . I'd like a cup of onion soup .	And what would you like after that ?	I'd like the roast chicken , please .

te_223	Hey honey , how was your day ?	It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while . He ' s in a bit of a jam .	Why ? What happened ?	Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ' t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ' t look into a couple of different HMO ' s .	Yeah , you ' re right . We aren ' t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .	Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ' s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too .	Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .	Well , we don ' t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine .	I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .	Not in a million years !

te_227	Can I have a look at that digital camera please ?	Yes of course . This is a really good one actually .	How much does it cost ?	This one is 1500 yuan .	It looks pretty good . I think I'll take it .	Would you like anything else ?	That's all thank you .
te_228	I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ?	What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !	It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .	You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .	The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .	Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?	It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .	It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .
te_229	Billy , you are late again .	I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ?	Yes he ' s in his office .	Oh , I hope he didn't notice me .	Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .	You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?	I think he might . You'd better go to his office .	You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .	Good luck !

te_231	Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ?	There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .	Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem .	And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .	Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify .	Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .

te_299	So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...	No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO -- the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .	How many people are on the board of directors ?	Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line .

te_316	Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?	Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?	I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .	If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?	Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection . They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
te_317	What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps .	I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .	Calm down ! Shouting won ' t help ?	He is really outrageous .	What happened ?	I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .	What ? He can't do this to you .	Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .	What did you do ?	I shouted it back of course .	Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?	What would you do if you were in my shoes ?	Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .	No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault .	I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate .	I am too angry to do that .
te_318	Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere .	Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out .	Will you have it later ?	I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you .	That's terrific . Thank you .

te_320	What game do you like ?	I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .	I ' Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ' Ve seen old men playing it in the street .

te_357	I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ?	It's simple . You can use call transfer .	Is it so simple ?	Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .	It's true .	Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call .	That's all ?	In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .

Fast food is so popular in this district .	That's true .	Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?	It was good . I brought lunch from home today .	You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .	Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .

Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .	Good idea !

Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?	Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job .

How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?	You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .	Does the card provide any other benefits ?	You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card .

te_392	Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?	Sure , let me take a look ...

But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?	Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .	It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?	Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .

That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .	Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?	I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .	Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .	Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .	How much do you think the rent will be ?	I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
te_403	I have a terrible toothache .	Which tooth is it ?	This one here .	Ar , Yes . There ' s a big cavity .	Can you fill it ?	I ' m afraid not .

te_407	The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge .	Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford .	Why is the price so high ?	It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .	Model of computers aren't compatible ?	Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .	Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .	But by then , the technology will be outdated .	True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .

te_415	It's time for bed .	But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ?	It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight .	I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .	Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .	Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .	You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?	Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .	An excellent idea . Work now and play later .	I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .	No , now it's bedtime .
te_416	Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?	Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?	Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .	I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .	Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?	Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?	That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?	Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .	I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .	I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .	Well , it's all new stock in the window now .	May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?	Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .	Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .	Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .	Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .	That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for .	There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .

A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
te_418	So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor .	Four is an unlucky number here , Peter . Four sounds like death in Chinese . Hotels often have no fourth floor .	I see . Oh , I know what I wanted to ask . How much should I tip this guy ?	People don't usually tip here , but you can . Fifty dollars should be more enough .

Travel Agency . Have a nice trip !
te_420	I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We ' re redecorating and are going to add some things .	Well , I ' ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week .	Let ' s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ' ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .	Fine . I ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday .
te_421	That looks graceful on you .	Thank you . But it is too bright for me .	How about this brown one ?	Let me try it on . I like that color .	Ok , i will get one for your . Here you are .	But it is too loose . Do you have the smaller size ?	Sorry , it had been sold out .	What a pity !
te_422	I ' d like to apply for a personal loan .	How much would you like to borrow ?	A thousand dollars .	Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high .

te_424	Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?	I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?	That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .	A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?	A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .	But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .	We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .	I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
te_425	Hello .	Hi . It ' s Tony calling from the dentist ' s office . Is Lily there ?	No , Lily is not here at the moment .	Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ?	Sure .

te_426	So what do you think of my new dress ?	I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .	Um , ninety-five dollars ?	Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?	I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .	Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?	I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
te_427	Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?	I did . Why ?	Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?	No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again .
te_428	Is it Fred's fault ?	No , I don't suppose he's to blame . The man in the other car made a mistake .	But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .
te_429	In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner .	How to adjust ?	Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes .	Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas .	That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .	Yes , sometimes the differences are great .	Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .	We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .
te_430	I hate doing the damn laundry .	Watch your language .

Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?	That's the one .	You mean we'll share the taxi ?	Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully .	Well . Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you .
te_433	Good morning . Are you Mr . Liu ?	My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ?	How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ?	Quite good , I think .

Well , you know , those styles or colors don ' t suit me .	What style do you want ?	I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .	Oh , I see . How about the color ?	Quiet color .	I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .	Really ? Let ' s go there .
te_435	Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?	Sure ! What do you feel like having ?	I really feel like having a big juicy steak !	Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?	I didn't know you were a vegetarian !	I'm not , I am a vegan .	A what ?	A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .	Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !	It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
te_436	How do you feel about that restaurant ?	It wasn't all that great .	What did you dislike the most ?	I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared .	Did you think that the food was any good ?	I wasn't all that impressed by the food .	The service certainly could have been better .	The service did not help the situation .	Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ?	I am not interested in trying this restaurant again .

te_438	I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went .	First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?	I am not sure what a home inspection is all about .	I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ' t surprised when you move in .	Wouldn ' t the owners have told me about any problems ?	Sellers aren ' t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ' t aware of .	Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?	You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .	What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?	There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found .
te_439	How you celebrate your Valentine ' s Day with your wife ?	I will take a rain check .
te_440	Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this .	Tell me what seems to be the problem .	My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .	Did you ever talk to him about it ?
te_441	What can I do for you today ?	I have a question .	What do you need to know ?	I need to take the driver's course . How many hours do I need ?	It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course .	I need to get my license .	You're going to need to complete six hours .	How many hours a day can I do ?

te_443	How far do we have to go ?	About 50 miles .	The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ' m sure we ' ll make it .	No , but we ' Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon .	Don ' t worry . There ' s plenty of time yet .	But it ' s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ' t it ?	Right .
te_444	Hello ! I'm sorry to bother you . This is a complimentary fruit tray . Your food will be ready soon .	Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist !	Actually , uh , I made it myself ...	You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ...	Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
te_445	How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ?	With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired .	I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime .	Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?	He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
te_446	Okay , so we're agreed on 900 .	I'm happy with that price .	Let's shake on it .	Okay , let's shake on it .
te_447	May I help you ?	Give me a Big Mac , a small order of French fries and a medium Coke .	You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer .	That's fine .	Your total comes to $ 7 .	Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?	Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .	Thanks .

Miao Ping , in your opinion , should we go for the Type A or Type B Account ?	Well , the Type B Account is very restricted . If your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your Settlement Account , I would recommend the Type A Account for you .	Thanks for your time . I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and I'll be back later .
te_449	Sarah , you don't look so good . What's the matter ?	I've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts .	It sounds like you're coming down with something .

I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China .	What course did you like best ?	I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work .	What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?	I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing .

We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products .	I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product .	To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price .	Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc .
te_457	I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend .	Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous . Therefore , I have to remind you of something . First , you should obey the traffic rules , don't break in the red light . Second , don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike .

Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .	I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?	Go right ahead .	Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room	Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions .	You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help .

te_498	I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season .	That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .	It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?	That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .	Certainly .
te_499	Hi , I need to copy something right now .	Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir .	Great ! How much per copy ?	Sir , one copy is ten cents .	Okay , I'll be down there shortly .	You probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir .

Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing .	We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors .
te_502	It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown .	OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .	I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ?	Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .	Oh , great idea !
te_503	So , Monica , how do you like your new office ?	Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !	That ' s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .	What was so bad about it ?	Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .	Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ' t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .	Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
te_504	Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ?	Yes , that ' s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 .	Yes , I ' m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .	Yes that ' s right .

I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .	I ' m sure . Okay , now let ' s move on to your work experience , shall we ?	Yes , okay .
te_505	Could you change these for me , please ?	What would you like ?	Twenties and some smaller bills , please .	Anything else ?	Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .

Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ?	Yes , I never seem to have any energy .	I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .	Thank you .
te_507	Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing .	Do you have a map of the campus ?	Yes , I have , but it doesn ' t help me very much . I ' m not very good at reading maps .	Do you know where your classes are ?	More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ' t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be .	That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes .
te_508	Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth .	Which train do you like ?	T112 to Washington please .	May I have your name ?	That's Lincoln .

May I have your passport , please ?	Here you are .	Could you sign each cheque here for me ?	Sure .	Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you .	Thank you . Goodbye .
te_511	What type of people do you work with most effectively ?	I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward . It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive .	What things impress you in your colleagues ?	I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .	What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?	The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .	How do you organize and plan for major projects ?	I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . Then , I set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .	Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .	I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks . The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me . Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .	How do you manage your time in a typical day ?	I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .	Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .	I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
te_512	Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?	Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !	I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .	Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .	It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
te_513	I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent .	You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you .	What did he say ?	He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming .	He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus .
te_514	Want to send out for some Chinese ?	Some what ?	Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .	No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?	Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .	Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?	Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .	What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .	Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
te_515	Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ?	I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .	It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills .	Is that true ?	Definitely !	If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone .
te_516	Hello sir , how may I help you ?	I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice .	I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?	It ' s not really an occasion , it ' s more like I ' m sorry .	Very well . This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .	I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?	Mmm , well this is our I ' m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .	I don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !	I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?	Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .	Get out of my store , you jerk !
te_517	I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?	I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .	You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?	I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .	Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .	Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .	How many people are on the waiting list right now ?	Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
te_518	How do you think they could be ended ?	I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .	So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them .	It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries .	Yes , it is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .
te_519	You still have not given me those files I ' Ve asked you for .	I ' m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ' Ve just been so busy today .	I really don ' t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ' re running a busy office here . You ' re going to have to keep up .	You ' re right , sir . I apologize . I ' ll get those files for you now .
te_520	What sort of job would you like to take ?	I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .	We need an operator now .	It's just the job I've been searching for .
te_521	I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .	I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .	And it takes up all the news .	The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .	It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .	Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .	I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .	Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
te_522	Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?	I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?	Sure . No problem .	Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?	Sure . Do you have my number ?	Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .	No problem . I'll wait for your call .
te_523	What are you typing there ?	I'm working on my resume .	Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?	Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet .	Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?	I didn ' t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good .	Maybe I should try looking on the web for work .	Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ' s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .	But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance .	How do you know if you don ' t have a try ?
te_524	Would you please show me the necklace in the window ?	Is this the one you want ?	No , the one next to it .	Here you are .	Thanks . What kind of stone is this ?	It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ?	Yes , please . How much is it ?	It costs $ 200 .	It looks good . OK . I'll take it .
te_525	Happy birthday , Jim !	Thank you , Lisa .	Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .	Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .	I'm very glad to hear that .	Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
te_526	What's wrong with you ? You look pale .	I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold .	When did the trouble start ?	I was sick most of the night .	It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .	Have I got a high fever ?	Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?	Yes , I have .	Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '	Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .	Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .	All right , thanks .	The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .	What shall I do today ?	I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
te_527	I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .	You can be sure of that , sir .	Thank you .
te_528	I called HP about my computer .	What did they say ?	They said I need a new hard drive .	That's too bad . How much is a new one ?	It's not too much , only about $ 85 .	Plus installation ?	No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .	Really ?	Yes , it's just a couple of screws .	That's nice .	It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .	If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you .
te_529	Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class .	Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .	Yes , Mum .
te_530	Is there anything wrong ?	I ' m worried about my daughter . She can ' t decide about college .	Don ' t worry . That ' s just a part of being a teenager .	I don ' t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .	You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ' t affect her decision .	But I just want to give her some tips .	Oh , she can make her own decisions .	I guess you are right .	Believe me . Everything will be ok .	I hope so .
te_531	It's beautiful here .	Yes . I feel refreshed .	How long will we dock ?	In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .	Yes . We come at the right time .

I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .	no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .	alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .	that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .	just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?	you've got a deal .	great . Bye .	bye .
te_533	I hear you are planning to travel abroad .	Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ?	In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .	Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .	Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .	And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it .
te_534	This looks like a very nice house .	You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .	The style of the exterior is just what I ' Ve been looking for !	The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .	This home is gorgeous on the inside !	Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .	The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .	Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .	I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .	The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .	There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .	I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
te_535	Room service . What can I do for you ?	l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room .	Sorry sir , we will bring you one . Anything else ?	Yes . Bring me a bath towel as well .
te_536	Good afternoon . British Airline . Is there any thing I can do for you ?	Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ?	Sure . When do you want to take the plane ?	Next Monday .	Will that be first class or economy seat ?	What's the fare for a first class seat ?	$ 200 .	Oh . I am not a wall streeter . Give me an economy one please .
te_537	Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?	Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .	That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .	And I can purchase that here ?	Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
te_538	Are there any beds vacant ?	Yes , what kind of room do you want ?	I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .	Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .	Well , that's fine .
te_539	Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .	That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .	You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?	Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t	Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?	Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .	Well , welcome to the team .
te_540	Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for .	Oh , thank you .	Is there anything I can do for you now ?	Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed .	Certainly , sir .
te_541	Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ?	Marry Lin please .	Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone .	All right , could I leave a message ?	Certainly !	Please ask her to call John .
te_542	Excuse me . Where is the way out ?	Well , that's what I'm looking for myself .	It's very confusing in here , isn't it ?	Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ?	It should be the way out .	OK . Let's go and see .
te_543	Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough .	Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now .	I think you should be more careful next time .	Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that .
te_544	Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project .	Look , Sally . I ' Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else .	No , I ' m sorry . I disagree . I don ' t think you ' Ve been working at full speed at all .	Well . I ' m sorry you feel that way .
te_545	Hi Joe , how are you doing today ?	Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?	Things are going well for me , Joe .	Want to go see a movie tonight ?	My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .	Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?	What movie did you want to see ?	There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .	I was thinking that I would like to see " The Secret Life of Bees . "	Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
te_546	How's the bride-to-be ?	Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .	Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !	I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !	Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .	You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...	I will . Don't worry !
te_547	Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?	Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .	Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .	I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .	Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?	Nothing .	What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .	Promise that you won't get angry .	OK , I promise . What is it ?	It's a kitty .	Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .	Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble .	No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .	Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .	All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .	I will . Thank you , Mummy .
te_548	I was wondering if you could help me with something .	Sure , anything you say .	Actually , it ' s a little bit silly .	Don ' t worry about it , just ask .	What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?	You need to know the type of shoes you want .	Don ' t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .	The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .	Let me write all that down . I ' m going shopping this afternoon .
te_549	Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ?	It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .	So , it has a history for more than a decade ?	Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .
te_550	What can I do for you , Madam ?	Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ?	Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?	Well , everything really .	All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in .
te_551	Let's do something outdoors today .	All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend .	Okay . what do you want to do ?	I want to go jogging .	All right . That sounds like fun .
te_552	Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month . This is my reservation note .	I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently . You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .	But I have been so busy all these days . Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one .
te_553	The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .	Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .	No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .	You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?	Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .	Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?	Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .	Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?	Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .
te_554	Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?	We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .	You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .	OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?	I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .	OK , will do .
te_555	I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas .	What size do you want ?	I wear size 40 .	How about this one ? It's the latest design .	Oh , I like the color .
te_556	May I help you ?	I'm looking for a pair of shoes .	What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .	I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ?	Of course , yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive .	How much are they ?	They are $ 168 .	I'll take them .
te_557	A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?	I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ?	Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .	Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills .	Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .	Ok , then we can sign up for it together .
te_558	Who's it knocking at the door ?	I think it's the postman . Will you go and open the door ?	All right . I'll get it .
te_559	Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?	No , we don't .	How many of you , please ?	Six , including two kids .	I'm afraid all the big tables are taken .
te_560	Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today .	If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results .	Are you saying that there weren ' t any problems ?	I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .	Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?	Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .	How will I know what the numbers mean ?	You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .	How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?	We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
te_561	This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee .	If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .	What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .	I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?	What's your proposal ?	Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway .	Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !	What would you suggest ?	The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .	That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .	OK . We can meet halfway again .
te_562	Hello .	Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ?	No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?	Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?	B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .	Oh , you mean Canal Street ?	That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .	Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?	At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?	I cannot get hold of her yet .	See you around , Carl .	See you later .
te_563	Has your company been affected much by government legislation ?	Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards .	What about your use of raw materials ?	Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ' re not allowed to use lead in our products any more .	What happens if you exceed the limits ?	We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .
te_564	Have you got any better ?	That's the best there is .	Okay , I'll take one .	That'll be $ 200 , sir .
te_565	Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ?	Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ?	No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back .
te_566	What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ?	External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors .	What are the internal factors that influence the company ?	The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .
te_567	I don ' t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday .	What words ? Can you tell me ?	He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ' t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ' t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .	Honey , I don ' t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .	Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .	I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness .	It ' s easy to say , but I will try .	Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .	I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ' t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .
te_568	How can I help you ?	Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith .	Do you have an appointment ?	Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .	I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?	Sure .	Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?	That would be very nice . Thank you .	Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared
te_569	did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?	no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .	yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .	they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .	they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .	I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .	did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?	I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .	Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?	yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .	I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .	people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .	I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .	that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .	thank goodness we're not rich and famous !	being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
te_570	Next , please .	Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months .	Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange .	Yes , I have known of it .	How much do you like to exchange ?	20,000 RIB .	In what denominations ?	It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .	Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .	Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs .	OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs .	It doesn't matter .	Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .	Thanks a lot . Good-bye .
te_571	Why are you holding me in this jail cell ?	We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night .
te_572	I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ?	That would be nice . How are you getting there ?	Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .	Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...	And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .	Which is more expensive ?	But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .	Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ?
te_573	I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .	What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ?	Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list .	They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ' s see what the inside looks like .	I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .	Signing the registry is a good idea . I think I want to see the kitchen next .	I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .	I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it .	Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?	The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars .

It's Mike's Sporting Goods .	Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?	No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .	I'm sorry to have bothered you .	No problem .
te_575	How about going to the cinema tonight ?	That's great . What's on tonight ?	I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .	Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .	Don't you think it's too bloody ?	On the contrary , very exciting .

te_589	What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?	First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations .	That ' s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ' ll need someone to hire staff .	I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ' t think we should use an agency , because they won ' t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of	Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .	Why didn ' t we choose an office in the CBD ?	The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ?	Yes . We ' Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .	When will the branch office open ?	Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .	Has and advertising campaign been prepared ?	Yes , it has .

te_591	did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?	why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .	well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .	do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?	no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .	it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .	religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .	what do you think about abortion ?	I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .	do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?	I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .	why not ? It's their children , too .	that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .	that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .

te_595	Have you heard what happened ?	Heard what ?	Deborah already had her baby .	I didn't know that .	I thought you knew .	I honestly didn't know .	The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .

What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?	The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ' t stop studying and creating .
te_600	The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !	Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .	That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !	Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart !

Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ' s going to be alright .	But I ... I still love him ! And it ' s all my fault ! I can ' t believe how immature and selfish I was being .

You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .	That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?	It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .	I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !

te_651	Honey , do you have a second ?	Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried . What ' s on your mind ?	We need to talk .	Okay ...	I ' Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .	What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ?	That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !	So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?	Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry .	Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me .	I can ' t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ' m only doing this for you . I don ' t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .	Laura ...	Here are your keys . I ' ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ' m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ' ll always love you . Goodbye .
te_652	Oh , my God . I can't take it any more .	What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy .	I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible .	Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change .	You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?	But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .	Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help .	Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .	I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .	Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .	That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that .	How about a training course ?	A training course ? That must be costly .	But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .	OK , let's have a try .	OK .
te_653	Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?	Oh , yes . You ?	Yes . What did you think of it ?	I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?	Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?	Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .	Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?	Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?	Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?	Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?	I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !	Yes !
te_654	My friend Jean is very beautiful .	What's her figure ?	Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .	What's the color of her eyes ?	Dark blue .
te_655	Where are you going ?	I'm going to buy a CD .	Why not listen to music online ?	Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ?	You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .	I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .	In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .	Can you recommend some to me ?	Certainly . Realplayer is a good .	Can I download it ?	Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .	I'll try it tonight .
te_656	What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .	Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .	Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?	He asked me how long it took me to learn English .	But , you were born and raised in California !	Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .	What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?	You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .	So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?	I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .	Are you sure he really got the message ?	Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .	That's hilarious ! What did he say ?	He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .	I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .
te_657	Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ?	Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him .	I see . Did they succeed in the end ?	Of course not . He drowned .
te_658	What can I do for you today ?	I would like to use a computer .	Do you have your library card ?	I sure do .	There is a wait for the computers .	That ' s all right .	You need to print your name on this list .	Okay . Now what ?	Once a computer is available , I will let you know .	How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?	All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .	That ' s it ? Thank you very much .
te_659	how are you doing , Christopher ?	to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !	are you doing anything this weekend ?	I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !	are you available on Sunday ?	yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .	ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?	that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?	it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .	what should I bring with me ?	we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .	I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .	do you like surfing ?	I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?	we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !	I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?	you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .	ok , where and when should I meet you ?	we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !
te_660	I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .	It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .
te_661	I give up ! I simply can't learn French !	Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress .	No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well .	Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ?	Good idea . That might help .
te_662	He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means .	You are interested in other people ' s business , aren ' t you ?	Does he mean I am inquisitive or I ' m noisy ?	Yes .
te_663	Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .	OK , please .	My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?	I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants .	Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ?	How old are your children ?	I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .	I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip .	It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help .
te_664	Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old .	Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together .	And after church they come here for lunch ?	Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ?	Yeah , what's up with that ?	The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun !
te_665	Hi ! I'm happy you could make it .	Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you .	What can I get you ?	I'd love a gin and tonic .
te_666	Could you please help me to check out the book ?	Sure , what's the author's name , please .	I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ...	Charles Dickens ?	No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature .	OK , do you know the title of the book ?	Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket .	So , show me the note please .	I can't find it now .	Oh , such bad luck , sir . Can you please name the category of the book ?	Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography .	OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please .	Thanks .
te_667	How do you decide what grade we get ?	I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests .	What is the most important factor ?	Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning .	How can we keep track of our grades ?	The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .	What if we can't get to school ?	You can only miss one class without penalty .	If we have a major problem , will you let us know ?	I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem .
te_668	We're thinking about going to America .	Have you thought about the cost ?	There is that .	I believe it'll be very expensive .
te_669	May I help you with something ?	I would like to return some books .	I ' ll take them .	Here you go .	These books were due two weeks ago .	Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .	You will need to pay late fees on these books .	How much are the late fees ?	The fee is 25 cents every day .	I have to pay 25 cents a day ?	And that ' s for each book that is late .	That shouldn ' t be a problem .
te_670	This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing !	It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ' m going to take a dip .	Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke !	I get too tired ! I ' ll just backstroke , it ' s easier !	Try kicking your legs more . That ' s good . Don ' t go out too far !	It ' s fine . Jump in !	Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark !	Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me !	It ' s right under you ! Kathy ! ! !
te_671	what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?	my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .	three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !	well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .	were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?	I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ' t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .	did your husband's family get to meet your family ?	my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t	that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?	we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .	you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?	not at all , but we don ' t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
te_672	Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?	I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .	Then let's go in .	I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .	I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .	I know . I wonder what's keeping him .	Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?	Yeah , a number of times .	What's he trying to pull anyway .	I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .	Maybe you should start seeing someone else .	You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .
te_673	So , you ' re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ' s the purpose of your trip to the United States ?	I ' m going to visit my brother . he ' s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis .	And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?	I ' ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ' s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March .

I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .	And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?	Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ' s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .

Congratulations !

te_676	Hi . What's your name ?	My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?	My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .	Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?	No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?	Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .	Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?	I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .	I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .	Why were you in Japan ?	My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .	That's pretty cool .	I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .	Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .	Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .	Ok .
te_677	Guess who I saw just now ?	Who ?	John Smith , the escaped criminal .	That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .	I think I must report to the cops .	Ok .
te_678	What do you think of this one ?	Eh , so so .	And this one ? Too flashy ?	Nah , not too flashy .	Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ?	I guess .	Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you .	And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes !	Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !	Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !	Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !	Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?	I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
te_679	Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ' s OK .	Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ' t go into detail , but it wasn ' t serious .	I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .	I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .	It must have really hurt afterwards .	Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ' t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .	I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .	I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ' t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !	Is there any pain now ?	No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .	Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?	Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .
te_680	How was the party ?	I had a fantastic time .
te_681	Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?	Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job .	Why ? You ' re not satisfied anymore ?	I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .	That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .	Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later .	Ok , good luck to you .
te_682	Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?	Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it .	But he seems to be very happy with Rose .	He is more nice than wise .

te_688	Thanks for your hospitality .	You're welcome .
te_689	I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble .	That's all right .
te_690	Hey , what's new ?	Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?	Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .	What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?	Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .	That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .	But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
te_691	Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?	That sounds great . Where are you going ?	I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .	What should I bring ?	Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything .
te_692	What do you think of doctor Thomson ?	I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease .	How can you be so sure ?	I can tell form the way he spoke to us .	Never believe his words .
te_693	Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO .	I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again .	Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .	Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it .
te_694	What do you think about violence in movies ?	Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch .	But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?	If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .
te_695	Are you free tomorrow night ?	Yes , I am .	Shall we have dinner together ?	Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?	Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .	OK . I'll be happy to join you .
te_696	If only our company prescribe flex time .	The board has been considering introducing flex time .	Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .	Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .
te_697	Brian , do you know how to speak English ?	Yes .	Where did you learn ?	I learned in college .	You speak really well .	Thank you .	How long have you been in the U . S . ?	3 weeks .	Is your wife with you ?	Yes , she just got here yesterday .	Have you been to California before ?	No . I've never been there .	Have you ever been to Las Vegas ?	Yes . I went there once on a business trip .
te_698	How are the children doing at sport ?	I ' m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ' s very fast for a kid his age .	He ' s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?	He ' s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ' s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ' s fine for someone his age .	Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?	The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .	How are they at swimming ?	They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .	Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .	I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !	I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .	It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
te_699	Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?	Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .	Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .	Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...	Is everything ready now ?	Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .	Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .	Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .	It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .	That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .	I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .	Thank you .	My pleasure .
te_700	Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?	Sorry , I thought you knew .	But you should have told me you were in love with her .	Didn't I ?	You know you didn't .	Well , I'm telling you now .	Yes , but you might have told me before .	I didn't think you'd be interested .	You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?	Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .	Oh , you men ! You're all the same .
te_701	Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ?	Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic .	What about water pollution instead of pollution ?
te_702	How ' s it going ?	I ' m fine . Thank you .	Do you need anything ?	I need you to help me .	What can I do for you ?	I am looking for an article in a newspaper .	Did you check the periodicals ?	I didn ' t even bother to think of that .	I ' ll show you where to find your article .	I get lost in this library .	It ' s right this way .	Thanks a lot for your help .
te_703	How about eating out for a drink with me tonight .	Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ?	No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?	All right . See you tomorrow night .
te_704	Hi , Helen ! how is it going ?	I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work .	Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you .	I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .	Why don't you take a few days off ?	I can't . I am really behind of my work .
te_705	Can you speak Japanese ?	Yes , I can , but not very well .	Where did you learn it ?	At school . And I'm still learning it now .	How long have you been learning it ?	About three years .	Can you speak any other languages ?	I'm afraid not .
te_706	Good afternoon , Johnson .	Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?	Not bad , thanks .
te_707	I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !	God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?	Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .	They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .	I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .	You'd better pay more attention to your health .	I will , thanks for your concern .	You're welcome .
te_708	It is too bad today .	What happened ?	My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it .	How did you find him at last ?	It was the police wo helped me to do that .	It must have taught you a lesson this time .
te_709	I want to give our kitchen the works .	Why ? I think it ' s convenient and good .	No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ' s modern .	Why should we run after the fashion ?	I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .
te_710	Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ?	I'm crazy about it . It makes me very excited .	Then tell me what's good about it .	It can't be expressed by words .
te_711	What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something .	I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband .
te_712	Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .	Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .	Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .	I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
te_713	Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?	Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .	Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .	That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .	Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .	Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .
te_714	Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?	What ? Why do we have to do that ?	Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .	I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !	That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !	That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !
te_715	I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?	Yes , I ' d love to . it ' s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .	I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .	Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?	I ' m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .	You ' re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ' s you favourite award category ?	You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film .	It ' s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress .
te_716	How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?	We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .	Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .	But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things .
te_717	How do you celebrate national day in your country ?	There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .	What kinds of parades are there ?	The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?	We don ' t have a national day .	Really ? That ' s unusual .	I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ' t .	Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .

I'm up for an adventure !
te_724	Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique .	But not as good as your mother's , right ?	Actually , it's better ...	What ? Are you kidding ?	No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ...	Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you !	OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ...
te_725	How many people are there in your family ?	Five . My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me .	Is your brother older or younger than you ?	He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday . My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age .
te_726	Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ?	I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really .	Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?	I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
te_727	Did you go to the concert last weekend ?	No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?	Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot . There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .	How much was the ticket ?	I only paid two dollars for mine .
te_728	Mary and Tom are breaking up .	It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ?	Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman .	Do you think they'll become reconciled ?	No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .	What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake .
te_729	have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?	sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .	as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?	to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .	but you look quite proficient in using them now .	certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch	yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i	anything strang about that ?	maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .	oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .
te_730	It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck .	Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway .	I can't forget it .	You'd better cool yourself down first .
te_731	Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction .

Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .	Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .
te_732	I hate to go outside .	Me too .	Why do you hate to go outside ?	I meet too many jerks .	I agree .	This city is full of jerks .	Rude people are everywhere .	But what can you do ?	You can yell at them .	And they will yell back at you .	Yelling doesn't do any good .	No . The best thing to do is just stay home .
te_733	I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth .	You mean you suspect him .	I ' m not sure . I ' ll try to prove my feeling .	I hope I can do something for you .

te_739	I hate computer games .	Why ? They are fine .	Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting .	Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .

Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well .	Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ?	OK .	Great !

I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago .	What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ?	I think it's just a matter of getting used to it .	I can't agree more .
te_745	Why don't you watch where you're going ?	Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !	There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .	Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in . You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out . And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes . All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .	I think my arm is broken .	Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .	Listen , let's just wait until the police get here . Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .	Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .	I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?	Alright .	It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .	Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .	Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .	Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .	It really hurts .	Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?	To hell with you . The accident was your fault .	I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?	To hell with you .

I'm working on it . Really !
te_749	Hi , Becky , what's up ?	Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .	What's the problem ?	She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .	For example ?	Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .	No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .	It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .	My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .

He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .	Me too .	Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .	Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?	Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .	He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .	And the host announced that he won it all !
te_756	Come in , come in !	Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ' t you meet me there ?	I thought we were supposed to meet here .	Don ' t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ' t make sense to meet at the apartment .	I ' m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .	Why don ' t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?	You ' re right . I am sorry . Let ' s go and watch the movie .	It ' s okay . I don ' t want to go now . We ' Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ' t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .

The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .	Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?

te_761	I think you're being a little naive .	If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item .	That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned .	eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase .	$ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ...

The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that .
te_768	I can ' t bear it . The driver is too bad .	He must be green . It ' s lucky that we will get off soon .
te_769	I prefer potatoes to eggplants .	I feel eggplants are more nutritious .	But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .	Oh , that's how you see it .
te_770	That way they look longer .	Now what are you doing ?	Putting on mascara .	Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes .	I won't .	And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face .

The couple with the dogs , think back .	No , I don't recall a thing about them .	Well , I've invited them for brunch .	Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded .
te_776	His grandfather is the richest person in the area .	What a miser ! He cycles to school every day .	His grandfather's money is not his .	I can't understand him anyway .
te_777	What did he say ?	He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .	It ' s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .	Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
te_778	I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . oh , there he is .	hey , Isabelle ...	Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .	yes , I am the guy ...	what a bummer ! You set me up ?	let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...

Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name .	OK . Then tell me what else you know .	Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ?	He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ?	Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet !

Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?	Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .	You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?	We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .	So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .	Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
te_787	Susan is going to get a divorce .	How do you know that ?	She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .	Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .

So I don't have to worry about them .	You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...	I'll take home economics .	Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .
te_789	Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts .	But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills .	What do you mean ?	They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets .	That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .
te_790	Ann , do you have time next Monday ?	Yeah , what ' s up ?	Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party .	Wow . I'd love to .	Great !	When and where ?

te_791	Hey Stacy . What's going on ?	I'm pretty tired these days .	Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?	I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .	How about your husband . Does he help much ?	Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?	That sucks .	If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?	That's crossing the line .	Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?
te_792	Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?	Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?	Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .	That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .	Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?	When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports .	I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?	Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it .	Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .	Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .	You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too .
te_793	How do you arrange this summer vacation ?	I want to travel .	Where would you like to go ?	The seaside .	That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .	I ' Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ' ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good .	Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .	Thank you !

te_796	Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish .	Oh , I ' ll go to shanghai to practice there .	That ' s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai .	I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .	And English is very useful in your job .	I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life .	You will be a very promising one .	That ' s my wish .
te_797	I hear you are expecting your family .	Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .	I didn't know you had a brother .	Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .	Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?	His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .	Does your brother have just one son ?	No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .	I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .	Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it .	So when are they all coming ?	My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday .
te_798	You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?	I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .	Where did you spend your holiday ?	I went to Paris .

Did you go to school here ?	Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .	Did you get a job right after graduation ?	No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .	When was that ?	Let's see ... That was about six years ago .	I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?	I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me . How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
te_800	Do you consider yourself a good mother ?	Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman .	How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .	I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .	Does your husband feel the same ?	Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
te_801	I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth .	let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .	I often do , but I ' m worried about the responses from other people .	you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .	I ' m worried that what I say will not make sense .	we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .	that ' s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?	that ' s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .	I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .	the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how .
te_802	What's his job ?	He used to be a policeman .	But Mrs . Smith hired him to find her lost son .	Yeah . He's a private eye now .
te_803	Bother the flies !	Where do they come from ?	I don't know . Something rotten here ?	I can't see it .
te_804	Have you got your invitation yet ?	My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?	The house warming party .	Whose house warming party is it ?	Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .	Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .	It's out in the suburbs .	Have you seen the house ?	Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend .	Is it nice ?	Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .	There's also a garden .	Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?	They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .	When are they going to have the party ?	Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .	Wow , that would be something to look forward to .
te_805	hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ?	I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .	oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?	we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec	wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !	tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?	perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .	no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .	we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .	great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .	no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .	Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
te_806	Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink .	Sounds good . Where are we going ?	Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .	Need a new . girlfriend , huh ?	Yeah , I broke up with Lisa . She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that !	Whew ! That getup is terrific !	Never mind the getup . She ' s beautiful !	That too .	I'm gonna introduce myself .	If you're lucky , that might do the trick .	Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here .	Hold on ! What's the big hurry ?	My ex-girlfriend's here . If she sees me , my goose is cooked .	I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's .	OK , catch you later .
te_807	Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ' s been such a long time !	Darlene ! Indeed , it ' s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ' Ve done with your hair !	Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ' t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !	Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ' Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated !	Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know .	He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course !	Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .	Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .	Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !	But of course ! Well , it ' s been great talking to you , but I have to get going .	Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !	That would be great ! Give me a call !	See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ' t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter .
te_808	Did you already take the history exam ?	Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?	I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?	Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .	What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?	I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .	Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .	If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .	Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .	Good luck .	Thanks . See ya .
te_809	What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable .	It's us .	What do you mean by " us " ?	Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?	What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?	Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .	Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?	Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
te_810	Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?	Yes . Do you like it ?	It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .	Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .	Is classical music your favorite ?	Yes . What about you ?	I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .	Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .	Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .	Did you always like pop music .	I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .	I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .	oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .	Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
te_811	It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young .	Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ?	Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .	Fortunately , things are changing these years .
te_812	Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .	A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?	There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me .	I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day .	What about sunday ?	i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday .	Maybe next week .	Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work .	Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .	I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .
te_813	Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ?	Yeah , I ' m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains .	Oh , do you go hiking often ?	I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .	It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?	Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?	Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .	Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .	Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .	Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend .	Thanks , I ' ll ask him .
te_814	How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !	I don't know if anything terrible has happened .	I have reported it to the police .	We'd better prepare for the worst .
te_815	You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?	He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?	I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .	I can think of better things to dream about ...	Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .	That's crazy .
te_816	Mike ! Look at the floor !	What's wrong with it ?	What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !	Oh ...	It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .	Sorry , love .	What are you looking for now ?	My cigarettes .	Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .	In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
te_817	Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ?	Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .	It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .	Are you Chinese by birth ?	Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations .	How do you like it ?	I like it so far . But my English still needs work .	I want to study Mandarin and public relations .
te_818	Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .	Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .	Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .	Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .	You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?	They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .	Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?	Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .	Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?	It's possible .
te_819	You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game .	Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !	Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats !	How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?	Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !	Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy !	The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .	What are we waiting for ? Let's go !
te_820	Let ' s play a game !	OK ! How about Scrabble ?	No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ' m going to describe someone ' s face , and you guess who it is !	OK !	Let ' s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !	Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !	Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !	Your future husband !	Not funny .
te_821	As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives .	It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points .	Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .	For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .	That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .	Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
te_822	Lee , I'm going to get married next month .	Good news ! And congratulations !	You are invited to my wedding .	Thank you . I'll certainly be there .
te_823	Thank you for lending me the book .	Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .	But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .
te_824	Don ' t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ?	I ' m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it .	Don ' t you think in that case , there wouldn ' t be so much stealing ?	Definitely . But I think it is too fierce .
te_825	The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ?	Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close .	That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?	It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?	Yeah . I think I can find it .	You're back already . That sure was quick .	That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .	Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .	Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .	Okay , let's go !
te_826	hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?	well , I spend a lot of time watching movies .	what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too .	oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ?	actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ?	art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .	really impressive . These two genres are totally different .	sure . I enjoy both of them very much .	how often do you go to the cinema ?	once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon .	movie salon ? where is that ?	it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there .	is it good ?	yes , you can find almost all new releases there .	really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership .	why not ?
te_827	Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby !	Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .	Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .	That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?	Three months .	Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?	I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .	Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .	I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .	There are so many things you have to prepare for .	I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .	It really must be an exciting time for you guys .	Thank you so much .
te_828	Mary seems depressed . What ' s the matter ?	She didn ' t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ' s hard work .	Poor girl !
te_829	Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide .	Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ?	That's what I'm wondering , too .	I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes .
te_830	Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?	Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then .	We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?	Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time .	What a pity ! You can't join us .	So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway .

te_832	Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .	If that happen to me , I ' ll take them back to the shop .	I did . But they said they won ' t change them .	That ' s terrible . But if they wouldn ' t change them , I know what I would do .
te_833	Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?	Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .	Totally agree . What is your solution ?	Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .	You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .	It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .	But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .	I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
te_834	I am so busy today .	Can I help you ?	I ' m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .	I ' ll be glad to help .	Or maybe make the beds .	All you have to do is ask for help .	Thanks . That ' s terrific !	I ' m ready and willing to help .
te_835	The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .	Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?	Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .	Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?	I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .	You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
te_836	You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .	I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .	Do you feel ok ?	Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .	Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .	Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?	You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .	Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .	Zach , what's that on your arm ?	I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .	It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?	Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .	I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .	Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?	We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .	Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
te_837	I can't go to your party .	That's too bad .
te_838	Do you like being a doctor ?	Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult .	Can you tell me about it ?	You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not .	What can you do when this happens ?	Not much , usually I'll just keep silent .
te_839	Have you eaten ?	Not yet .
te_840	It's too hot to read .	We'd better go out for a walk .	Which season do you like best ?	Spring .	How about summer ?	I dislike it most .	Why ?	Because the hottest season is summer in a year .	But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
te_841	My son came home from three years in the navy .	It was a real red letter day for you .	Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
te_842	John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?	Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?	It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .	You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
te_843	I must be going .	Okay . Keep in touch .
te_844	Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .	I ' m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment .	I don ' t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?	Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .	But the reservation keeps the car here . That ' s why you have the reservation .	I know why we have reservations .	I don ' t think you do . If you did , I ' d have a car . See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ' t know how to hold the reservation and that ' s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .	But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ' d like .	Fine . I ' ll take the compact .	Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?	Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car .
te_845	Do you think Tom will be elected president ?	No , I think Harry will get it .	Let's make a bet on who gets it .	OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .
te_846	I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .	Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .	You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ' t that strict ?	To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression .	But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ' re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .
te_847	What happened ? Why didn't he win ?	Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .	How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !	If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .	What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?	He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .	They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .	That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .	I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !	Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .	I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .	Let's hope so .
te_848	Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?	That's because Americans love sitcoms .	Sitcoms ?	Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .	In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .	I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
te_849	Are you interested in history ?	Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .	I love history , but I ' Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .	I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !	Some people say that history repeats itself .	What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?	The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .	I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
te_850	You're looking great .	You , too .
te_851	What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today .	You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not .	Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .	It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .	Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?	Yes , they say I would get a big sum .	Have you discussed it with your wife ?	Yes , she leaves it to me .	As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .	I have to think about it .
te_852	Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ?	Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L .	Of course .
te_853	I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0 . 1 of a second .	That ' s great . He ' s the best runner I ' Ve seen this season . I ' m sure he ' ll win a medal at the Olympics .	I think you ' re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ' ll win ?	I really don ' t know . I don ' t think we ' ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .	What do you think our chance are in other events .	In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events .	We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .	I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .	You are very optimistic !
te_854	Helen , did you hear I ' m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place .	I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me .	Well , drop by if you can .	I will , do you want me to bring anything ?	No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there .
te_855	It's said that John's broken up .	Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .	I hear that John's leading a double wife .	It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
te_856	Let's play chess .	I haven't played chess for a long time .	That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .	Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .	You're a very good player	Not really , but once I won a prize .	So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .	My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .
te_857	You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?	Yeah , about .	Do you know Chinese better now ?	Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .	Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .	I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .	A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .	I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .	Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us .	Yes , absolutely true .
te_858	Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?	Harry Potter .	Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ?	Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny .	Got it .	Have you ever read this book before ?	No , but my little brother likes it very much .	It's really a good book . You will like it too .	I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much .	Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ?	Jane Austen .	Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite .	I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite .
te_859	Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .	Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too .	I guess we'll see just around .	Ye , I hope so . well . Take it easy .	You too .
te_860	Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !	I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !	But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !	Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !	What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?	Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !	So he talks about you behind your back ?	Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !	I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .	I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .	My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO .
te_861	Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !	What is it ? What happened ?	I think someone is stalking me .	No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?	I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .	What did you do ?	I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .	Did he leave when you left ?	Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .	What did you do ?
te_862	Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ?	Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ?	Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .	Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat .	Is it close by ?	It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?	OK , I'd love the company .	This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
te_863	have you ever been to Disneyworld ?	when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which -- is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?	the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .	that's right . Why do you ask ?	well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .	when are you getting married ?	some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .	congratulations ! I had no idea .	thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?	do you like amusement parks ?	for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .	if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .	even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?	even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .	thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .	I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
te_864	Matthew ? Hi !	Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?	It's got to be almost a year now .	How have you been ?	I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .	Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?	Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .	Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?	Mrs . Thou ?	Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .	Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !	I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?
te_865	Are you ready to go to the mall ?	Yeah . Dig my new pants ?	Copycat !	What do you mean ?	You went out and bought khakis , too !	No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki .	Whatever .
te_866	Have heard of Paul ?	No , what ?	He's got a promotion .	You're kidding .	No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .	I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .	Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .	Well . Good for him .
te_867	Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?	I think the supermarket is closed now .	Oh , When does it close ?	It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .	That's too bad .	Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 .	Alright . What do you want to do now ?	Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .	Where does she live ?	She lives in San Francisco .	How long has she lived there ?	I think she's lived there for about 10 years .	That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?	San Diego .
te_868	Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ?	No . How about you ?	Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner .
te_869	Who's that ?	Search me .
te_870	I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ' s not still mad at me .	What did you argue about ?	He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ' t have the money yet .	Well , he should pay you back . It ' s only fair .	Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ' t have got angry .	Did you lend him a lot of money ?	Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .	Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ' s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?	No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up .	Of course you should . You wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
te_871	Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .	I don ' t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .	Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .	No , you can ' t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
te_872	Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ?	Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world .	They must be amazing animals .	They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea .	I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men .	They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .
te_873	Oh dear , my weight has gone up again .	I am not surprised , you eat too much .	And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help .	No , I wouldn't think so .	I do wish I could lose weight .	Well , why don't you go on the diet ?	I've tried diets before but they've never worked .	Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class .	Yes , maybe I should .
te_874	Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets	All right .	Here is your ticket .	Thank you .	The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .	Really ?	Yes , let's go in .	It is a new park , isn't it ?	Yes , how do you know ?	I guessed it .	Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .	Oh , how wonderful !
te_875	I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .	I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .	The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .	Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .	Don ' t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .	Can you ride a horse ?	Yes , I can . I don ' t ride regularly though . How about you ?	I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?	What a good idea !
te_876	Where's Mrs . Johnson ?	Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner .	I see . Can I sit down ?	Of course ! Make yourself at home .	Thank you , Mr . Johnson .	Please , just call me Tom .	Okay , Tom .	Where's Cindy ?	She's upstairs in my room .	Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner .
te_877	Have you heard of Paul ?	No , what ?	He's got a promotion .	You're kidding .	No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .	Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .	Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .	Well . Good for him .
te_878	Let's speed up . We're going to be late again .	If we hurry , can we get there in time ?	I hope so .
te_879	Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ?	Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ?	Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on .	Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look .	OK , let's go .	The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here .	Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead .	Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck .	Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce .	Wow , Bruce crossed the line first .
te_880	Tim ' s smiles are interesting .	Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful .	You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .	How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles !
te_881	Have you enjoyed your weekend ?	Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble .	Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha .
te_882	The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .	It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it .	Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .	That's true .
te_883	I ' m forming a music band .	Do you already know how to play an instrument ?	Uh ... Yeah ! I ' Ve told you a thousand times that I ' m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band .	Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?	We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ' t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?	Yes , I ' m a singer .	Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .	Great ! Wait here ? You don ' t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ?
te_884	What would you like for Christmas ?	I would like to have that new style Gl Joe .	Have you asked Santa ?	Yes and I've written him a letter .
te_885	Lili , let ' s take a vacation !	George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ' t have much money left after paying the rent .	Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ' t cost much .	Where will we sleep , then ?	In the van .	What about other expenses ?	Let ' s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ' t spend much . Come on . Don ' t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ' t we ?	Maybe you ' re right . When do you plan to go ?	The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait !	Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet .	As long as we ' re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .	Let ' s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !	You have such good ideas !
te_886	What date will our field trip be on ?	The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ?	Yes , I will make note of that .	Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7	I will be there half an hour early .	You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ?	Yes , someone is picking me up .	To get back to campus by 8	Not at the moment -- maybe later , though .	All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday !
te_887	The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot .	I'm sorry for hero .	I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .	Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect .
te_888	How was your business trip ?	Great - they wined and dined us all week .
te_889	Nice to meet you here . How come you dropped into this company today ?	My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here . What a surprise . How long have you been doing this ?	Two years or so .	That is great . Do you have to work the night shift ?	No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .	Do you enjoy work here ?	It is hard to say . But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant . Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .	Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .	Luckily not . The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .	Glad to hear that .
te_890	Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe .	What's the second solar system ?	It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .	Is this good news or bad news ?	It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !	You mean with people on it ?	Yes ! Isn't that exciting ?
te_891	Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?	Sorry , I thought you knew .	But you should tell me you were in love with her .	Didn't I ?	You know you didn't .	Well , I am telling you now .	Yes , but you might have told me before .	I didn't think you would be interested .	You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?	Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .	Oh , you men ! You are all the same .
te_892	How was the movie last night ?	I didn't really like it .	Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .	I found it very disappointing .	She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .	I wasn't happy with it .	Nothing is to your satisfaction .
te_893	Honey , I ' ll be right back !	Where are you going ?	I told you already ! I ' m going to get my nails done .	Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?	Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !	Why ? I don ' t want to have nail polish or anything like that !	They don ' t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !	Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
te_894	Good afternoon !	Good afternoon ! Sit down , please . How are you ?	I'm very well , thank you . How are you ?	Very well too , thank you very much . Isn ' t it a lovely day ?	Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .	Yes .	What's the weather like in your country ?	Mm ... It's quite warm now .	Where do you live ?	In London . Where do you live ?	Here . Near this school .
te_895	I ' Ve had it ! I ' m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !	So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?	That ' s exactly what I am going to do ! I ' Ve decided to create my own company ! I ' m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !	Have you ever written up a business plan before ?	Well , no , it can ' t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ?	You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .	Well , that seems easy enough .	Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .	Geez . Is that all ?	Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !	Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
te_896	I hear that Mary got mad .	So I heard .	What ' s wrong with her ?	She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .
te_897	Um , what will you do this weekend ?	How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while .	A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?	No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?	Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too .
te_898	What ' s on TV tonight ?	Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel .	Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal .	Oh , come on . That ' s such a girl ' s show .	No it ' s not . It ' s just funny .	Yeah , if you ' re a girl .	Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl .	That ' s not true . Dark Angel is a good show .	It ' s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .	O . K . , O . K . Let ' s forget it . There ' s a football game on too .	No way . I ' m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ' s to watch the game .
te_899	It ' s really terrible !	What are you talking about ?	Don ' t you see many parents are forcing there children ' s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all .	You said it . Many parents just don ' t know how to educate their children .
te_900	Sarah , what did you do today ?	I went shopping .	Did you buy anything ?	Yes , I bought a few things .	What did you buy ?	I bought this coat . Do you like it ?	Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?	At the mall on 5th street .	Was it expensive ?	No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .	That's cheap .	I know . It was a really good deal .	I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
te_901	Hi , Victor . How are you ?	Oh , I'm fine .	So , are you going to go to class tonight ?	Maybe ... but I don't think so .	Really ? What's the matter ?	I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .	Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .	Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
te_902	How's John doing ?	He can barely make ends meet .
te_903	The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .	They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .	If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .	No way , if it still has 21 .
te_904	What's that book you have under your arm ?	It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .	How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .	I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .	Is it really worth paying for ?	I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .	If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
te_905	Come on , you are left behind !	Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .	You just need more exercise .	Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !	I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .	But running so fast is not good for people over forties .	Why ?	We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .	But I want to burn up more calories !	In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .	Really ? I will slow down then .
te_906	Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?	Fine , thank you . I haven ' t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?	I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .	Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .	Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .	It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .	But it's really exciting .	Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .	Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .	Yep .	I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .	Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .
te_907	It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession .	The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .	Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .	It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .
te_908	Are you an art aficionado ?	Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ' t you ?	I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .	I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ' t pay much attention in art class at school .	Art isn ' t for everyone . I ' m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ' s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .	I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ' d love to go with you .	I thought I ' d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .	That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?	Let ' s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .
te_909	What does your mother do , may I ask ?	My mother works in a company as an accountant .	Is she busy ?	Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year .
te_910	Hello , Bessie .	Hello , Jack . Happy birthday !	My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday .	I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them .	Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .	Now let me sing " Happy birthday " for you .	Thank you very much .
te_911	Nice day , isn't it ?	It sure is .	It's a good day for a picnic .
te_912	Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?	I don't want to .	Well , come over and talk to me then .	Certainly not .	May I turn on the TV then ?	Turn on the TV for what ?	So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .	Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?	I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .	To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .
te_913	Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages !	Brian ! How have you been ?	Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !	Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before .	Well , you look great ! How are you ?	I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now .	That's terrific !
te_914	How is your new dormitory ?	It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .	Well , do you all major in the same subject ?	No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .	That's great !
te_915	Peter , how often do you exercise ?	Well , I swim and run every day .	Now , tell me , what do you eat ?	Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .	Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?	Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .	What do you drink ?	Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
te_916	What ' s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?	We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .	How hard is the climb ?	It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .	What did you do last week ?	We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .	Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ' m sorry I missed it .	Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .	Yeah , I will . See you then !	O . K . See you .
te_917	How many languages can you speak ?	I can speak French and German .	How well can you speak them ?	I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well .	Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ?	No , but I'll be able to tomorrow .
te_918	Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?	Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .	It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .	You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .	Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !	It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .
te_919	Do you really have to work today ?	Yes . I'm afraid so .	But you'll miss out on the football game .	Oh . Well , it can't be helped .
te_920	How smart of you to book the tickets before hand !	Oh , do you really think so ?	Of course , otherwise you ' ll just have to wait for hours .	But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight .
te_921	I had an accident .	That's terrible !
te_922	I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last .	You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining .
te_923	Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest .	Come on ! You're pulling my leg .	Really ! Here's my trophy .	Wow ! Congratulations !
te_924	What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .	Thank you .	Is that your wedding ring ?	I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .	Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?	In June .	Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?	Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .	You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .	Thank you so much .	What kind of watch is it ?	It's a Tag Heer .	If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?	This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .	That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .	Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
te_925	I'm really mad at Bob .	What for ? ( Why ? )
te_926	Hi , Jack , how have you been ?	Not very well .	Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?	Nothing .	Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .	Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .	Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .	Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .	Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .	Maybe you're right .	Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !	Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ...
te_927	Do you know Sally ?	Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .	Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock .	Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career .
te_928	Excuse me . Do you have the time ?	My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think .	Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ?	If we start now , we can make it by taxi .
te_929	Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?	Yeah .	Who won ?	China .	What is the score ?	China beat Brazil three to zero .	Wonderful .
te_930	What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in .	The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again .	Again ?	At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip .	Ouch .	Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour .
te_931	You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill .	I'm sorry . I won't do it again .	Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign .	Is this the sign ? What does it says ?	It says No smoking here .
te_932	Good morning . I ' m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?	Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?	First , I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .	That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .	How do you research your books ?	I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .	I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !	Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .	Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?	There ' s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ' t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ' ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .	Thanks very much . I ' m sure it will sell well . I can ' t wait to read it . Here ' s my card . Thank you for you time .
te_933	What shall I call him ?	Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry .	What's he doing ?	He's checking bags . He ' s an official in the customs .
te_934	For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party .	That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !	I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .	That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .	Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .	Will it be an all day event ?	Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .	That was quick thinking .
te_935	I'm so glad I bought this watch !	Cool ! Flashy red lines !	I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .	Is it waterproof ?	Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .	Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?	Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
te_936	Do you take a bus to and from work ?	Yeah , everyday . And there ' s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .	Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .	Oh , yeah , it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .	That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .	What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?	You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !	Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?	Yeah , absolutely !	And it ' s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .	You were so happy , weren ' t you ?	What do you think ? I ' m a good boy .
te_937	We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .	That's great .	Now let's get things ready .	Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center .	That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .
te_938	Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .	Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .	And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .	Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .	There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .	That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .	Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .	My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .	OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .	Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .
te_939	It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul .	The boy is good for nothing .	As a teacher , I don ' t know how to help him .	He is hopeless .
te_940	Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?	Not bad . We have had a big meeting today , remember ?	Oh , yea . I forgot . So how did it go ?	Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .	Great , so what happens now ?	Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
te_941	Do you believe in UFOs ?	Of course , they are out there .	But I never saw them .	Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .	You mean that you can them .	That's right . I can see them in my dreams .	They come to the earth ?	No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .	Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?	OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .	That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?	Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .	Wow . Sounds fantastic !
te_942	You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?	Yes . I ' Ve won the first prize in the math contest .	Really ? Congratulations !	Thank you , Paul .	By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .	Good , happy birthday to you !	Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ?	Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .	My pleasure .
te_943	Do you have a minute ?	Sure . What's up ?
te_944	Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?	Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch .	May , I really regret watching it with you last night .	Did it scare you ?	Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .	Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .	Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary .	I like scary movies .	That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies !	Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .	Don't call me kid . I am a grownup .	Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?	Of course ! I can watch them without you !	Oh , really ?
te_945	What is your nationality ?	I am Chinese by birth .	Where is your domicile place ?	My domicile place is Hebes Province .
te_946	I know you have a son . How old is he ?	He's going to turn six next month .	Who is looking after him ?	My mother-in - law . She retired last year .	You really are lucky !	Yeah , I know .
te_947	Say , what's your favorite sport ?	Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better .	Do you play much tennis ?	Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ?	Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all .
te_948	So Janet , do you do any sports ?	Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby .	Yeah , how often do you go ?	About three times a week if I can .	Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ?	Not really . I ' d really like to try golf , though .
te_949	Hello , Ken .	Hello , George .	Have you just been to the cinema ?	Yes , I have .	What ' s on ?	Paris in the Spring .	Oh , I ' Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ' s an old film , but it ' s very good .	Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?	Yes , I have . I was there in April .	Paris in the spring , eh ?	It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .	Just like dear old London !
te_950	They got a divorce at last .	It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .	You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .	That give us a good lesson .

I don ' t trust you any more .	You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ' d be lost without you . I won ' t let you go anyway .
te_953	Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?	There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers .	Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa .	Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food .	What is the international community doing to help ?	The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region .	How many countries have been affected ?	Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries .	I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran .	Yes .

Are you serious ?	It ' s the truth .	Are you okay ?	I really wanted to get into NYU .	I am really sorry to hear that .	It ' s okay . I ' m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway .
te_958	Why are you so quiet ?	My girlfriend just broke up with me .	You must feel terrible now .	Yeah .	I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too .	You've been through this too ?	Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .	But it hurts too much .	I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .	What if I don't want to find another girl ?	You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .	You're right .	I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?	Yeah . Thanks for the talk .	I'll give you a call later . We should hang out .

te_962	Whatever we do , we should do it above board .	You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table .	Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels .
te_963	Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again !	Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ?	Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .	Can't Elvin handle it ?	I think he's got too much on his plate .
te_964	This is the best dinner I've ever had .	How about the soup ?	I've never tasted anything better .	How nice of you to say so .
te_965	Hey Nick , what are you up to ?	Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ?	Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ' t know man .	Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ' s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim .	Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !	Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ' t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ' t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ' t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !	Wow , I didn ' t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !	The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?	Let ' s do it !
te_966	Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ' t seen you for a while .	I ' m fine . I ' Ve been out of town . I just got back .	Where were you ?	I was in New York for a wedding .

I've fallen in love with my boss .	really ? Is he married ?	no , of course not . He is still single .	then what's your problem ?	I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .	oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .	worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .	office romance is very tricky .	it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .	cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .
te_969	You're not looking happy . What's the matter ?	Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .	With the job ?	With everything , with everybody , with all this !	A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .	It wasn't always like this , you know .	What do you mean ?	Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .	You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .	Certainly , perhaps .
te_970	I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is .	Hey , Isabelle ...	Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .	Yes , I am the guy .	What a bummer ! You set me up ?	Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...	How dare you ! ( starts to walk off )	Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !	Why did you lie to me in the email ?	I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .	I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .	I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .

te_972	Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?	Yeah .	Who won ?	China .	What was the score ?	China beat Brazil 3 to 0 .	Wonderful !
te_973	Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work .	I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .	Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client .	I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .	It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .	Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !
te_974	Isn't it wonderful walking here ?	What do you mean ?	I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .	Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .	It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?	You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .	What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?	Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St . Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture .	What's there after that ?	Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .	What are they all for ?	Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places .
te_975	Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?	I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .	What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?	Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .	And your parents took it badly ?	That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .	Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?	She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .	How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?	Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .	Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .	What do you mean ?	Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .	I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .
te_976	Do you think they two will get married ?	Yeah , you can count on it .	I think so . Yes , they get along so well .	I like him . He's good for her .	You're right . He sure is .

te_979	Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?	Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss . Parker speaks to us only in English .	I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?	Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .	It must be interesting to study English .	Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss . Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .	Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?	Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
te_980	It's quiet everywhere in winter .	Yes . I like winter .	Me too .	It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?	That's a good idea . Let's go !	What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .	Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .	I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .	Yes . Very wonderful .	There is a snowman over there .	How lovely it is !
te_981	Tim's always bothering me .	Just tell him off .
te_982	Who are those guys ?	Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ' Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ' star players .	Oh .	Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !	All right !	Here comes Jordan , though .	Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .	Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing .	Which team do you think will win ?	The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
te_983	I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr . Stone .	It's ok . What do you want to ask ?	Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?	The first place you should go is the International Center .	Why ?	You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .	What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?	They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .	Can we get any more help at the International Center ?	Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office .	I see . It must be worth going to .	Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .	Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students .	It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them .
te_984	hi , Lander . What's wrong ?	I can hardly make ends meet these days .	same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .	my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .	true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .	definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .	the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .	is that inflation ?	inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .	has the government taken some measures to curb it ?	yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .	but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .	you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .	how ?	for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .	sounds a good idea .
te_985	OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing .	You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .	Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .	You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .	The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !	Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
te_986	Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?	Yeah , almost . But there is one thing .	What ?	I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...	What is it ?	Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .	That makes you feel uncomfortable ?	Yeah . we never do that in a public office .	Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .	I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .	Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .	Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?	Yeah .	Oh , I'm shocked .
