Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."	I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.	Oh my god. You are pure evil.	Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this

Whats wrong with you?	Nothing!	Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.	But um, I dont think its anything serious.	This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!	No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!	Thats a hernia.	Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!

I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!	I knew that was him!	Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.	Hey, you ok?	I guess.	There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.	I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.	Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.	Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.	Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?

This is so much better than the first time we went out.	Yknow?	That was so awkward, we were really nervous.	Didnt you sleep together?	Yeah, that really calms me down.	And!	We have so much in common!	She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a	Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do.	Okay.
21	How does she do that?	I cannot sleep in a public place.	Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.	Oh! What what what! ...Hi.	It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.	What's going on with you?	I got no sleep last night!	Why?	My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.	Oh, and deaf.	So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.	You have no idea how loud they are!	Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.	Thanks.
22	Ew! What is that? Something exploded!	It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?	Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?	Breathe, breathe, breathe.
23	Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.	Okay! You dont think I thought of that?	How can you not know which one?	I mean thats unbelievable.	I mean, was it Gina?	Which one is Gina?	Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.	No, no, no, thats Dina.	You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!
24	I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny.	Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.	You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.	Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.	Really!?	Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.

Really?	: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, shes the same size as me.	No, Im good.
26	Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?	Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so	Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?	Who knows?	Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.	Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!	Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!	Yeah!	Actually, that can't happen.	Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.	So it'll be either you two  or you two.	Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.	Yeah, it is.	No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.

29	Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.	I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".	Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.	David is going to propose to Phoebe.	What?  Why?	Chandler, we have talked about this.	You are not supposed to give people advice!	Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?	I	They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!	She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone	Man, that's some	Oh, that's not what you want...
30	This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.	It-its great to meet you Paul.	I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.	Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.	So Ross, what your problem?	Eh-whExcuse me?	Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age?	Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny.	I	Okay.	I can, I can see that.

But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.	What?! You totally get embarrassed!	No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.	Is that so?	Yeah.	Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am
35	I cant believe it!	I did it!	I rode a bike!	I never thought Id be able to do that!	Thank you Ross.	Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.

Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor.	Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking.	Yeah.	I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.	Oh, hey, how about this one.	Ah, its says so in the script!	Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.	It doesnt say that in the script.	It does in mine!

I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.	...Joe.	Y'ever been in love?	...I d'know.	Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.	You're one to talk.	Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.	Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.	Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
42	Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?	Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
43	Hey, Rach, how was work?	Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.	By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.	Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.	Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and...	Something wrong?	No. Nothing.
44	And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.	Yeah, that's it?	Yeah.

48	Bye.
49	Well, not really.	I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.	Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.	Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.	Yeah. What-what should I do?	Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.	I mean whats more important?	What people think or how you feel, huh?	Ross, you gotta follow your heart.	Joey that is so sweet.	Hey.	Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?	I couldnt do it.	You couldnt do it?!	Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight.	What?!

Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.	Wh, Ross what do you want from me?	You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
52	I know.	Ooh, I have to tell you something.	What?	But I cant tell you.	Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.	Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods.	Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?	No.	Does it have to do with Joey?	No.	Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?	No, but lets come back to that later!

And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.	You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.	Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?	Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!	And youre my big brother!	I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world.	Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.	I was scared of telling you.	Well Id be scared of them, but all right.	Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.	I want him to have his uncle.	Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?	Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!	Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.	Thats right! By his uncle too!	And by you.	Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment.	Come here!	No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!

62	Hey Bob.	Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today?	If I see him, Ill ask.	Toby!	Yeah!	Oh then you know each other.	Were on a semi-first name basis.	What do you think of adding him to our team?	Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes.	Really? They love him down on six.	But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
63	Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!	A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?	No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!	What?	Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.	You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!	So?	SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
64	Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"	Well then we still have a problem.	Yeah!	With what?	Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies.	Oo! You should have one of us do it!	Phoebe, were getting	No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!	I call it!!	What?! No! It was my idea!	Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.	Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!	We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
65	See, I see.... big passion in your future.	Really?	I do.	Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
66	That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.	Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.	Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.	Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.	What?!?!	Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.	You can spill. In the sink.	Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.	I love you, too.	Aww, good.  What?	What? Im just said.	No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is.
67	Oh my God! Are you serious?!	Uh-huh.	I would love to live with you Ross.. thats-thats great! Thank you!	Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.	Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!	I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.	You just saved me!	Youre my hero!	Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.	Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!	Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?	No.	No, I wont.	But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.	She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!
68	...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?	Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.	Lose the robe.	Me?
69	That's great.	Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?	No, no, I'm still working on mine.	That's it?	Yeah, it was really hard.	Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.	Ok, you weren't there.
70	Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!	Pretty nice?	Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.	We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.	Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.	You gotta take the canoe!	All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!	Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!	Good for you!!
71	Pheebs?	Yeah?
72	Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.	One ticket to Yemen?	Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.	Im sorry sir, I dont understand.	What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?	Are you travelling with a child?	No.	All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
73	Okay, but this is the last time.	With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.	Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.	Hey.	Hey.	Hows she doing?	She?	Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?	I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.	Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.	Excuse me?	What?
74	Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.	Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.	Well sensitive is important, pick him.	Yeah.	Oh sure, go with the sissy.	Jason is not a sissy!	Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
75	Hi.
76	So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?	Yeah.	Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter.	I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way.	I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.	It was an amazing night.	It was. It was an amazing night.	You think it looked amazing?
77	Do we have a name yet?	No, not yet.	Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.	Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.	Hello baby girl.
78	Ah-ha, nowhere to run!	I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over	No Rachel! They got here first!	Why is Ross doing that?	DANGER	Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
79	No thats all right. Dont worry about it.	Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!	Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!	Really?	Yeah! Look!	Ive never lived like this before.	I know.	All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
80	Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?	I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!	Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so	Also so	Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!	Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!
81	OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.	About what?	He's planning your birthday party.	Oh my God! I love him!	You'd better act surprised.	About what?	My surprise party!	What surprise party?	Oh stop it. Joey already told me.	Well, he didn't tell me.	Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.	This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.	No, you are not. We tell you stuff.	Yuh-huh!	I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.	I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.	Looks like I was second to last.
82	Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.	Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.	Chandler! Hes your father.  he should be at the wedding.	I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.	Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!	Its not like we run in the same circles.	I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.	Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.	Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.	So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.	Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
83	Hello! Whos in there?	How ya doin?	Who in the hell are you?	I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
84	No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!	No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!	Im not gonna marry Chandler!	Not after this!	Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.	I gotta go.	Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
85	Sorry I'm late, but I left late.	Okay.	So Pheebs, what is the book about?	I thought you said you read it in high school.	Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
86	Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?	Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?	I thought you didn't smoke.	Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?	Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?	And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"	But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.	We get high.	Oh, me too.	I'm kidding.	Oh, me too.
87	Oh, are you sure you're ok?	Yeah.	Does it still hurt?	Yeah.	What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.	Hi.	Hey, how'd it go?	Excellent.	We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.	What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
88	You know what? You are right. I	Good for you Pheebs!	Ok.	Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean
89	This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!	Its 6:00.	Hi!	Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well.	Handling it?	What do you mean, handling it?	Theres nothing to handle.	Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua.	Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!	What?	Come on!	They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!	And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off.	Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres.
90	What the hell is this?!
91	What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?!
92	This sucks!	All right, whats my next present?
93	All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?	Enhh	Ive got canned goods.	Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!	Excellent hole, Joe.	Oh no! No!! My hole!!	Ow!! Ow!!!	What?! What?!! What is it?!
94	My drinking?	Oh, I mustve said that after you left.	Said what? Exactly.	That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.	Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!	Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!	If youre gonna get all sensitive about it!	I dont want to lose you.	What if I, create a position for you?	Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.	Say more things like that.	You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.	Id need an expense account.	Done!	And an assistant.	Sophie, get in here!
95	Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.	Oh my!	They're male nurses.	Not in my head.	Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?	Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.	What?	What are you talking about?!	You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.	I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.	Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.	Umm, why don't you give	What?	Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?	Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some	Yep! There's always room for	Joey, how do you make	Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad
96	Hello, this is Monica...	Yeah???	Oh...	Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.	Thank you.
97	Okay. Lets bring it in.	Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.	Here you go.	That almost hit me in the face.
98	Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
99	Hey!	Hey!	Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.	Oh boy, me too!	Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours	Yeah?	Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!	The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!	Thats me! Come on!	Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.	Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.	Shrill?! The wedding is back on!	I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.	Hi! Nice to meet you!	Nice to meet you too.	So, are you ready to go?	Yeah.	Chandler!	Ill be right with you.
100	Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.	Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.	You can take it off.	Just slice that baby right off!	Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?	Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.	Well that's not a third nipple.	No?
101	First of all, it's on your ass.	Well then, what is it?!
102	Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?	I'm with Hamilton!	He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
103	Umm, this is great wine.	Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.	Really?	Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.	I studied for a year in Barcelona.	Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking	I love hiking!	Oh thats great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
104	So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married.	Oh we-we didnt.
105	No-no. We	What?!
106	Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh thats all.	Why?!!	Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this.	Oh. Well then shut me up.	Just tell me how.	Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
107	Let it go, Ross.	Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.	Do you all promise?	Chandler? Do you promise to be good?	You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!	Hey, Pheebs.	Dear Ms. Buffay.	Thank you for calling attention to our error.	We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.	We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -
108	Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the	Honey, both yours.	Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!	Yeah? The work problem?	Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.	What problem did you tell him you had?	Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay.
109	Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?	No thanks, Mom!	Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha!	Very good,  so good.	I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.	Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call.	I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.	Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!	Come on! Look where you are!!	When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.	Remember, a virgin for me please.	Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.	Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.	Well, if you think it will help.	No!	That was a test!	In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!	And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice	You should! How is she?	Ohhh!!	I think somebody needs another lap dance.
110	All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.	You do?	You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.	That and arrogance.	Hey.	Hey! How was sailing?
111	Wow thanks!	Joe?	Yeah!	Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?	When? Today? Some, not a lot.	Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.	There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.	Dont worry about that man, that happens.	Its happened to you?	Yeah! Once.	Well, whatd you do?	I did it anyway.	Sup? Sup dude?	Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.	So youre playing a little	Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.	Come on man, really how old?!	Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
112	And they knew about it?	Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?	Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!	Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is!	The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
113	Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?	Do you always have to bring him here?	I didn't wanna leave him alone.	Alright?	We- we had our first fight this morning.	I think it has to do with my working late.	I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...	Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.	Oh, that'd be great!	Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.	Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
114	Check this out.	It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!	"Its almost as good as being there."	Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!	Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
115	Uh, may I help you?	Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.	Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.	All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.	Nobody sees the king!	Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king.	Hey! You cant go back there!	Oh my God.
116	So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?	I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.	Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a	Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?	Yeah.	My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.	I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.	No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
117	Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.	Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.	No, I just I think that its too soon.	No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
118	I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.	And now you want that money back.	Exactly.	Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?	Its not a real game! I made it up!	Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
119	I don't know.	But I can see through your sheet.	Yeah, yeah, that's her.	But y'know what?	Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.	Why?	Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.	What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!	No. No. No. She lives on the	No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.	And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.	You've been counting wrong.	I did
120	Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.	Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.	Why? Do you have the answers written on there?	No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.	All right, lets do it.	All right, gentlemen, youre up first.	Okay.	Okay.	You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?	Big fat goalie.	Correct. Rachel claims	Dangerous Liaisons	Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...	Weekend at Bernies
121	Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.	Yeah, come on, we can be guys!	No you cant.	You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.	Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!	Okay.	Im sorry.
122	And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.	You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.	Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.	Pete, can I get you something else?	Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out.	Havent you and I covered that topic?	Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.	Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.	Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth.	And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.	Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?	Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?	I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.	That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.	I mean really, think about it.	Ho-ho, I will.
123	I believe I read that somewhere!	That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!	Okay?	Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...	It's not funny!	I respectfully disagree.	I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!	Who cares? Nobody reads those things	You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.	I don't have a page.	Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
124	I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.	Okay, what is in here? Rocks?	No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.	So, rocks.	I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.	Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?	I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.	Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?	Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice	You	Why?	Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!
125	I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised?	Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.	Ohh, its time to go.	Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.	Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?	Twice?	Well thats ambitious.	Hey, uh, you can ignore that.	Thats Carol with your son!

133	Come on, pick up, pick up!
134	Hello?
135	Transit Authority?	Yes, hello.	I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.	Hi, here's the deal.	We lost a carseat on a bus today.	It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.	Oh, and there was a baby in it.	He wants to talk to you again.
136	Hello.	Im sorry Im a little late.	Whoa	Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.	So to sum up, Im Professor Geller.
137	Good evening, sir.	My name is Ross Geller.	I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.	And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry.	I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you.	Man, I wish I was naked.	I mean, this-this looks so great.	That is how God intended it.
138	Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!	But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!	Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!	Okay, you go!	My turn? What-what are you talking about?	Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.	What?!	I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."	And he said, "Laundry?	Is	Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.	Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.	Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot.	What?!	Mr. Bigot. He tells the most	All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.	Me and Chandler?!
139	I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.	Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?	I don't know! I didn't come with her!	All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!	A test?!!	Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!
140	Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?	Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him.	Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.
141	Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.	I think its best sir.	But we really do need to find someone up here.	The work is starting to pile up.	Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.	Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.	Thats a good one.	What does a guy have to
142	Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.	Hi, Julie!
143	Isnt there a national football league.	Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.	Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.	Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?	When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in.
144	Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?	I dont know. You uh, you got something for me?	Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.	Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women.	Really?	Yeah, for you!
145	Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!	That's	Hey, I've been honing!	What was with the dishes?	Oh, uh..	I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?	I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.	Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!	Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!	Great, now he's waving back.	Man, we gotta do something about that guy.	This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.	It creeps me out!	I feel like I can't do stuff!	What kinda stuff?	Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.	You cook naked?	Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.	What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
146	Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.	Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know.	Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.	You think you know me so well.	Well, dont cha wanna?	Yeah.	Okay, well I do know you.	Thats what I said.	Well so?	I cant.	I cant.	She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.	Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.
147	Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.	Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?	It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.	It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.	Nuh-uh.	Yuh-huh.	So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?	Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.	This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?	No.	Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?	Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my
148	Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?	That's the rule.	What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!	How'd you get to that?	Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio	You knew about that?	Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.	Ok, ok, How about if we split it?	What do you mean, like, buy it together?	Yeah	You think we're ready for something like that?	Why not?	Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?	Why, are you moving out?	I'm not moving out.	You'd tell me if you were moving out right	Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...	Aw, I know all about Kip!	It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.	Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?	Aw, don't do that
149	Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.	Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.	No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later.	Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
150	Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry!	Aw forget it, its from	You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!	Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
151	Okay! So, well just stay married.	Yes, exactly!	And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!	Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more.	What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!	Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?	Really?	I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!	Its	Ohh, okay, Im sorry.	Youre right.	Yknow what?	Im asking you to do me a favor.	You are asking me to be your wife!	And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
152	Oh my God!	I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.	My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?	Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-	-leg?	That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.	You actually broke her watch?	Barry, I'm sorry...	I am so sorry...	I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...
153	No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan.	Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea.	Okay, okay, bye	So what are they doing?	I dont know, something girlie.	Hey, youre early.	What are you doing with the lamp?	Im just taking it to be re-wired.	Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week.	No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.	Youre disturbing my oboe practice.	You dont play the oboe!	I could play the oboe!
154	Ohhh! That is soo sweet!	Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.	All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!	What is going on?	What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!	Ross!	I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!	What do I have to do to get some service?!	Hi Rach.
155	Ross?	Yeah?	Hey its Mona! From the wedding.	Oh hi!	Hi!	Wow! Uhhow are you?	Im good except umm, you still owe me a dance.	Oh thats right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?	Oh youre serious. Sure!	Great! Well umm	I think I might need one more cup of coffee.	Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.	Okay.
156	Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.	Go!	What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?	I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.	I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.	Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?	Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?	Uh, lets rip!	Really? Are you sure?	Oh Phoebe!	Okay, sorry. Yeah.	Hey Rach.
157	Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.	Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and    I wanted to share it with you.	Oh, you're so wonderful.
158	It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.	Wanna peek?	No!	Come on!	We’re not peeking?	Well I’m peeking.  Oh my God!	Hello sir, you know Monica.
159	Chandler is fantastic!!	What?!	Yknow how people just click?	Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click!	Did he tell you?	Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good heart?	Oh, I know...	Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.	Isnt this great?!	Dont spoil it.
160	Hi.	Hi, sweetie!	Hello.	Hi, Ross.	Yeah, huh.	I?ve got some bad news.	What?	I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.	Come on sweetie!

162	I think the check in is that way.	Ahh.
163	Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!	Well theres some people who do want to marry me.	There are?	Yeah! Richard!	R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!	Thats right.	Chandler	You just told me that he hates marriage!	That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife!	That-that hes against marriage and always will be!	You got
164	You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.	I knew.	You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.	I did.	Oh.	Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?	Sometime?	Maybe?	Yeah, maybe...	Okay... okay, maybe I will...
165	Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.	Well, youre amazing.	Oh no-no-no.	A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?	Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.	Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.	Oh, I dont know.	Oh-no-no-no, you are!	You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.	You mean with Casey.	No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool.	Or Casey.	No-no, Kathy.	Could be Casey.	No. No, Kathy.	Consider Casey.	I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey.	How bout I fix you two up?	What do you think?	That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
166	Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?	Honey, whats the matter?	I just saw Janice.
167	Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know.....	Wow! This girl is good.	Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.	I like her.	Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?	Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people.	Look at you. All jealous.	Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more	Say you'll stay beside me	Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done.

Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs.
168	Yes, hello.	I have a question.	Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.	A beard and a moustache.	Thank you.	No,	What?! What else did he say?	Umm, he said he thought I was funny.	So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.	Ross, no! There is	Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.	Ross, I am a human doodle!!

I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?	Well usually...yeah!	Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.	Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.	Im such a jerk.	Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
171	Hmmm... this is so nice.	OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.	OK.	OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....	Ohhh!!!!	Yes, yes, that's right...	Oh, look at the little cat!	What?  Ow!
172	Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.	I didn't mean	It's brilliant!	Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!	well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...	Thank you, Chandler.	Sincerely.	Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.	David, I'm pretending to

Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half!	We are switching at the next rest stop and	All right. All right.	Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.	Really? I dont	Sing!!	Morning!
174	Everything was delicious!	Thank you!	It was. The duck in particular was superb.	Thank you!    You haven't said anything...	Actually I do have one small complaint.	Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.	The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!	What musician?
175	We did?	You owe me 20 bucks.	Thank you. Thank you so much!	Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.	Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?	What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?	All right, I'm nine years old.	Oh, I hate this story.	We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.	I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.	Oh my god.	Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
176	Hey, who's this little naked guy?	That little naked guy would be me.	Aww, look at the little thing.	Who are those people?	Got me.	Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.

177	So, whats this about?	Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.	No.  This is my red sweater.	Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.	Whats going on Rach?	Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?	Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called.	I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.	Oh, its just not the right time.	It is the right time.	Okay.

Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?

So what, so what you saw him with a girl?	Who cares?!	That doesn't mean anything!	Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.	She was kinda stupid.	You're right.

We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.	Oh!	I can't believe he remembered!	Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.	I can't believe he did this.	Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?	What did you just say?	F-hah.... flennin....	Oh.... my God.

189	I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.	Maybe we should check the trash chute.	Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.	That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.	Hey!	There he is!	Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!	Just, y'know out.	Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!

Itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.	I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.	What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.	Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know.	You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
194	Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry.	Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up.
195	Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right.	Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?	Okay, great.	You freak.	Thank you.	Um, coffee to go, please.	Isabella Rosselini.	Are you serious?  Oh my God.	Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list.	Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it?	Yeah, maybe.	Oh-oh, you lie.	What you dont think Id go up to her?	Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.	Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.	You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate.	Okay, hold my crawler.	Okay.	Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?	Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im just sorry we dont got popcorn.
196	Okay, that's, that's enough.	Won't you dance around with me.	A-ha!!!
197	Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies!	Excuse me?	It's me, Joey!	Do I know you?	Joey!	Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.	Okay thats fair.	All right.
198	Good!	Pick one.	Left!  Thank you.	Youre welcome.	Ross!	Joey!  We should just switch.	Yeah absolutely!
199	Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you.	Oh thats all right!	Yknow, I ended up having a really good time.	Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.	So what was it for anyway?	I wanna say a disease.	Hey!	Hey!	I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on	Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth!	Oh-oh Professor Geller.	Ahh, to be 13 again.
200	Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?	No! He blew us off!	What?!	I know!	I cant believe it.  Can I tell you something? Im a little mad at him now.	Can I tell you something? Me too.	Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him	Ooooh! Freeze him out.	Thats right!	I like it!
201	Doorknob?	Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.	Oh good.	Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.	So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet.	Its-its too soon.	Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks.	No. I think you misunderstood what	You are so adorable.	That! Lets talk about that.
202	Hey!	How do you feel?	Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.	Okay, so I	And protected them from a tornado?	Oh my God.	I know, the babies are asleep.	Phoebe, what, what happened here?!	I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!	But my apartment!	Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.	Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.	Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!	When will that be?	Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
203	Hey Ross! The babys kicking!	What?! It is?!	Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.	Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?	Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping	A dreamless sleep.
204	So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!	Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!	Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.	Okay.	When are you coming home?	What? Guys, I'm not.	C'mon, this is us.	I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-	Waitressing?	Okay, I'm not just waitressing.	I'm..	I, um...	I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh...	I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
205	We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?	So, um, will you bring the truck?	I'll even let you ring the bell.	Oh, my god.	See, there you go, the cleansing works!	They're nice guys.	Oh, they're firemen guys.
206	Your son.	No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.	Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.	What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,	Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.	I got it.	I got it.	I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.	No, you don't.	All right, that's it. I want both of you out.	Why?	He started it!	No, you started it.	I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.	Now go!	Thanks a lot.	See what you did.	Yeah, listen...	Out
207	Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?	Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.	Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.	Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.	Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.	You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.	Boutros Boutros Gali.	He says he was too.	Interesting.	So I was wondering....	Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.	Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.	So you're a chef?	Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.	Oh, really.	Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?	Well, I was having a conversation.	Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other.	What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?	That would be great. Thank you.
208	so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!	Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.	When did that happen to you?!	Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!	Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.	Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.	Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.	Here, I'll get it.	We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.	Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.	Oh, great!	Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!	That was unbelievable!	Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.	I don't believe they're brother and sister.	They're brother and sister!!!
209	Action!
210	I found the picture!	What picture?!	The picture of my wife! In your pack!	You went through my personal property?	Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!	Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!	Cut! Wonderful!	Great scene yeah?	Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.	Heres your call sheet for tomorrow.	I know.
211	So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.	Oh yeah, I should probably call them.	I remember when we first got engaged.	Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.	Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened.	You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!	What a sweet story.	Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.	What?! They wanted a scary story!	Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.	What?	You tell her Jack, I cant do it.	What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?	We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
212	After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,	Did that!	Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.	Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!	Was it not pain-free?	No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.	Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.	Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.	But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.	Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
213	Now umm, remember Im still learning.	One, two, three, four!	You know the song! Sing along!	So?	No!
214	Oh my God! Thats David!	David who?	David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!	Oh my God!	Oh, you say someones name enough, they turn around.	Phoebe?	David!  What-what are you doing here? Arent you supposed to be in Russia?	Yeah, Im just, Im just in town for a conference. Umm,	Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?	Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.	Yeah.
215	Yes! Santa's coming!
216	Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.	Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?	But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides
217	Whatever.
218	Okay, Mon, back me up here.	Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?	And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?	I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.	Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal.	Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it.	Yknow, hey I understand.	Yknow?	Hey, when Im in a play and youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right?	So its yknow, its uh, its cool.	Ill see you tomorrow.	Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave.
219	You did look like an idiot.	Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.	All right?	Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"	And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"	Yeah that's the same.	That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.	Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?	Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.	Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.	Y'know, for me anyway.	And of course, the Indians.	Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
220	Hi, guys.	Hi! Phoebe.	Hi Phoebe.	I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow.	No we	Hormones.	hormones, yeah.

Oh well, give it time.	So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate.	How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?	Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.	They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!	Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!	Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.	I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.	Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?	No.	Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.	Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts
223	Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs	How many times have I told you guys, you	Hi Chandler.	Hey!

Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.	Yeah, so?

No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy.	I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.	Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."	Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!	I think I need a drink.	Yeah!
227	Hey, Pheebs?
228	No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!	Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.	And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.	You really think I'm ready?	Uh-huh!	Wow! Cool!	Was the chord at least right	No!
229	Well, this has been fun.	Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.	Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.	Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457.	And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
230	Were beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....	Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you.
231	Okay, thats a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.	Excuse me, Im sorry, Im gonna have to call you back, Ive got a Schemp in my office.	What are you doing?	Im sorry.	But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.	Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop.	Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes?	I dont have ten minutes!!	What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?	Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont!	Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week.	Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, Ive got a deadline, would you just go home, Ill talk to you later.	Yeah, but wait...	Good bye!	Actually, thats our three hole punch.
232	Oh yeah? When?	I'll tell you what.	When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?	Why won't I be married when I'm 40?	Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.	Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?	No, no, no.	What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?	Uh, uh.	Well?	Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!	Hey.	Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.	Did you go home and change?	Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?	No, I haven't seen him.	Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?	Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?	Yeah, why?	No reason.
233	I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!	What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
234	Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!	Yeah, thats her.	Thank you.	Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!	Yknow what would work?	Stop making candy!	You mean they like you.	Maybe.	Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?	Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
235	We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!	Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?	Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!	Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the end the way you guys did it back then!	What? We could do it!	I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.	I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go.	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8	I cant do it!	Now you do that, youre on TV.
236	Hey!	So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...	Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?	Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid" T-shirt anymore.	Well, I like it. Here you go.	All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?	Oh, I embarrass you?	How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?	Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?	Theyre all tourists.	All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.	Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.	Good choice.	Thanks.	Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
237	So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?	What?	Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.	And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my	Whoa, whoa, whoa.	You don't even know me...	Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.	What?	The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.	I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...	No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?	Oh yeah.
238	Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!	Okay, heres what were gonna do.	Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.	You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.	Okay?	All right, here we go.	Haul ass!!!
239	So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.	So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...	...and live forever as a machine!	That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?	You and I, we're interfacing.	Yeah, I gotta go.	Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
240	David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.	Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.	See?	Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".	Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.	Oh, I should go, too.	Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
241	Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.	And she was like "Oh, don't worry!	I asked him.	He's totally ok with seeing you!".	So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!	Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!	Exactly!	And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!	I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,	Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.	Ok, that'll be great!	Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.	That's not what we're gonna do!	Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
242	Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.	Hello Skidmark.	Its a nickname, Ill explain later.	Its pretty clear.	Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.	Thats why you broke up with me?	You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
243	Ni-chou chi-ma!	Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
244	Hi everyone.	I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.	Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.	What did, what did he say?	Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.	So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.
245	Oh, great!	We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.	Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.	All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"	And did he?	Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.	Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.	I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.	Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.	Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?	You sound like a guy.	No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."	Oh my God!	Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!	Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!	I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.	Youll have a last kiss.
246	Thank you so much for coming back over.	Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.	I know Mona, just hear me out.	First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.	Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.	Focus.	Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are
247	All right wheres that turkey!	Joey! Those are my maternity pants!	Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
248	No.	No!	Oh, would you look at that Monica?	I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.	Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!	Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.	Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
249	Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?	Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.	Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.	But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!	I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!	Or Friday with no two pizzas!	All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.	No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!	All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?	Thats right!	Cause Im a Tribbiani!	And this is what we do!	We can eat!
250	Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.	Look at this!	Oh! You have a window!	Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...	Oh look! That guy's peeing!	Hi.	Hi.
251	Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?	Okay. Lets use this brush.	Okay. This stuff?	Yeah.	All right.	Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.	Okay-Dokey
252	Where exactly is your zoo?	Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.	Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?	Yes.	Does he, uh, fight with other animals?	No-no, he's, he's very docile.	Even if he were... cornered?	Well I, I don't know. Why?	Uh, how is he at handling small objects?	He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...	How about a hammer, or a small blade?	Otherwise it's just cruel.	He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.	We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...	...He's in.	He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!	You're making a big mistake here.	I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
253	My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.	Really helped speed the process along!	Janice!	You're not... gone?	Sid is still in his room.	I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.	So did you do it?	Did you make your deposit?	Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!	That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?	I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.	Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
254	Phoebe, where's your purse?	No, no! Give it to me!	You can't have it.	Give it to me!	No	I'll go in there.	Oh yeah.	Phoebe come here	Haha!	Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
255	What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.	I just had sex.	Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?	Well, you never told me how old you were.	Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?	I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...	Don't say it.	...in love with you.	Really?	Sorry.	Well,fall out of it.	You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.	Oh god, oh god.	I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.	I'm Joan Collins.	Who?
256	Thats right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!	Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?	You. Like you havent done enough.	Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.	I mean I wish I were a seahorse.	Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies.	And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea.	God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!	Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end	Oh Phoebe, thats a great story.	Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?	Oh God, get out!	Get out!!	Get out!!	Get out!	Lets.
257	All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.	Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?	I cant watch!	Oh.	Seriously, how can you watch this?	Arent you scared?	Terrified.
258	Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!	Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.	Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?	Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.	I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.	Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I	Fine! Maybe I will too!
259	Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.	You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!	MY SANDWICH?!!!	MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
260	Whats the matter, Pheebs?	She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!	What?!	Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.	Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.	She knows, and she wont tell me.	Aww Pheebs, that sucks!	Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.	Where ya going?	Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.	Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.	Well, are any of those people here?!
261	Oh my God, so do I!	I knew it, wow!!	Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?	Ohh, so cute.	Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you.	I know. Im mad at me too.	Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry.	Hey! Me too!	All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.
262	Ok, you can do this.	It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.	Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.	Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.	All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
263	Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!	Really?  My God, hes really cute.	Go for it.	Phoebe, Im engaged!	Im just saying, get his number just in case.	But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.	Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged.	Well you should be embarrassed.	I did, but that was really fun.
264	Hey.	Chandler. I sensed it was you.	What?!	Unagi. Im always aware.	Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?	Whats up?	I cant figure out what to make Monica.	Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.	Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?	Yknow what?	Shed-shed love this.	Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8.	I made it in the sixth grade.	Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.	Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.	But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.	Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.	Why not?	Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
265	Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!	He might still show up.	Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours.	Is that all?	I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?
266	Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
267	Um, its going to be a small ceremony.
268	Uh, tiny!	Were not even sure why were having it.
269	Its actually going to be just family.	Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing
270	Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.	Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.	Oh great! What, you brought Joey?	Well, I brought the next best thing.
271	Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.	Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!	Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!	You're so sweet!	Ohh, you're so sweet!	Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.	Huh.	Well? Aren't you gonna do something?	Uhh.	You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?	Nah.
272	How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!	Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?!	Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!	No!	Do you like car games?	Yeah, yknow the license plate game?	I	Ooh, Ill play! Ill play!	No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
273	Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?	I cant figure this out!	Its so hard!	Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah!	Paper cut!	Now, have you told anyone else?	No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.	You told me.	Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.	Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.	Me too.	Hey.	Hey.	Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?	Oh all right.	Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.	Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place.	How rude.	Oh, Im sorry. You wanna bite?
274	The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!	What?	The ring is gone!	Ugh.	Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!!	You lost the ring!	Youre the worst best man ever!	Dude, this isnt funny!	What am I gonna do?!	I go to bed last night, everythings cool!	I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone!	You slept with the stripper?	Of course!!
275	What difference does that make?!	Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!	Joey, do you have a minute?	Dude, what am I gonna	Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.	Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!	Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.	Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have	What-what is it, what is it?	Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.	Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!	Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!	I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!	What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?	And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!	I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone	I'm not listening to you!
276	Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!	Hey, come on now!	All right, what are we havin?
277	Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation.	Ill take those to go.  For the kids.	Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?	It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said.	But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.	Understood. So, whatd you say back then?	Well, I said that I
278	Ha!	So you like the drums!	That's, that's great!	Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.	All right, okay, well, apparently not!	So, yay!	Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...	Tequila!!	That's fun.
279	Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?	Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.	Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.	Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.	Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.	All right thats it, school is in session!	My God! Is this a gym card?	Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times.	So why dont you quit?	You dont think Ive tried? You think I	Who is Maria?	Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat.	You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?	No!	So youre strong enough to face her on your own?	Oh no, youll have to come.
280	Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that.	Exactly! Because it's in the past!	Anybody gonna eat that?
281	Pheebs!	Hey!	Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?	Yeah!	Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear!	I know. They were mine.	Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!	No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.	Thats weird!	Im wearing his briefs right now.	Thatskinda hot.
282	I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.	Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.	And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
283	Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!	There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.	Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.	Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!	I dont think you could ever do that.	Hey! I	Okay, whatever.
284	Lusts of the flesh.	What?	I dont know.  A cowboy theme?
285	Hey uh, is it okay to come in?	Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!	Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.	Hey!	Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?	Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my  breast?	It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen.	Yowza	Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.	Dear Lord.	I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?	Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…	Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?	She looks scared.	Doesn’t she  look scared?	Y’know, I don’t really know her.
286	Can you see my nipples through this shirt?	No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.	Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?	Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
287	Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.	Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...	No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.	The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.	Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...	Pathetic mess?	I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.	I'm thinkin', cha-ching!	Thanks.	Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.	You're doin' this.	Hi. She said yes.	Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
288	"Happy birthday to you!"	Youre paying for that.	What? No-no its her birthday!	Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!	But it really	You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.	Damnit!	Rach? Hi!	Hi!	Did you tell your sister to ask me out?	Well yeah	Oh wow!	I mean, wow!	I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!	Really?!	Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"	Oh so-so not really never.	I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.	I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.	Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.	Oh-ho, and mine!
289	No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.	WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.	Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?	Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!	Chandler?
290	I-Im sorry?
291	No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!	Oh yeah?
292	I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.	Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk.	Hang-hang on.	Hey everybody!	Uh, Im gonna kill myself!	I got nothing.
293	Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!	I didnt know he could get me fired!	What am I going to do?	Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.	Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.	No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!	Thats not a bad idea.	Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.	Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.	So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?	Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.	Yeah, you wish.	"You wish."
294	Why are you yelling?	Whoa, that
295	Whoa-whoa, what is it?	Well Its a date.	A date?!	No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!	Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this.	No, Im gonna!!	Thats right!	Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl!	Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!	And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!	ThatIts not the same thing! This is	Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!	She was?

And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?	And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.

"Pheebs, cant make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy."  Big Daddy?	Oh thats a nickname we were trying out.	Hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!	Hey!	Oh! Heres Joseph Francis!	Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!	So what?! That doesnt give you the right to ditch me!	Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!	Phoebe hes right, that is the rule.	I dont accept this rule.	When we make plans, I expect you to show up.	Okay, I cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better!	Yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!
318	Did you know he was in there?	No.	How long have we been home?	About a half an hour.	Love
319	Lights.  Uh, romantic lights.	Ooh, nice.	So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.	Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.	Well ah, Ive been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life	Yeah?	And I feel like Ive conquered the business world, and I feel like Ive conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.	Wow.	Theres one thing missing.	Whats that?	Its time for me to conquer the physical world.	Okay.	Monica, I want to become  the Ultimate Fighting Champion.	You wanna what?!	I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! Its the most intense physical competition in the world, its banned in 49 states!	What are you talking about?	Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, Ive even had my own octagon training ring designed.	And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.	Yeah.	Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.	I want you close enough to smell the blood.	What do you think?	My parents will be so happy.
320	Okay to come in?	Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.	Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?	What?!	Im the ruptured spleen.	Why would you do that?	Because you shouldnt be with him.  You should be with me.	Really?	When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!	Look, things like last night they dont just happen.	Or at least not to me.	Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend.	Chandler!	I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor"	There was just one woman, wasnt there?	No, there were two.	Including me?	Oh yeah.
321	Hey!	Welcome back!	Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?	I dont know, Im still pretty tired out from this afternoon.	Why?	Uh, the sex.	What sex?	Our sex.	We didnt have sex.	Well if I didnt have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like	Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!	Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
322	Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker?	Either that or shes just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
323	Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
324	Im your mother.	Ehh?	Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler...	Hi there.	...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really know what happened with that either.	And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.	And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either...	Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.
325	Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
326	Well yeah, I lied before.	Oh!	Oh God	Now you know how you really feel about it.	Oh-oh, thats a risky little game!	Are you really gonna do this?	Yeah. Im gonna have a baby. Im gonna have a baby. Im gonna have a baby!	With who?	Ah, its still not the time.
327	You said I was boring--Ohh!	When did I say you were boring?!	Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!	Phoebe! You and I have	Oh, come on!	Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake?	We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!	Okay, there's a
328	All right, Im leaving!	Because Im not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move.	Thats you Rachel!	Yeah, I got that.	And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?	You take care Jill.	Okay, see ya!	Bye-bye	I-I cant believe Jills gone.  I cant help it, I opened a gate.
329	How about, youre moving!!	Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!	Hey, how are you guys doing?	Great! Monicas moving!	I am not!	Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!	Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know whats going on here. Okay, you guys	No Phoebe I am mad!	Well, deep-deep-deep down!	Yeah, Im just mad!	Then keep running.
330	Okay!	Oh, heres that trench-coat that you wanted.	Oh great!  Wow! Yeah, its comfortable.	Yeah?
331	Oh! Here we	All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?	I'm sorry.	It's just 'cause I couldn't be there.	Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.	Sorry.	What happened?	Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.	See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!	Get out!
332	I just didnt see the fast song coming.	Shh.	Shh.	Dont try to talk, well get you up to your room, well soak your feet, youll be okay.	Oh, thank you.	That is so sweet!	Yeah.	No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.	Tell me about it, I feel like Im holding down the fort all by myself.	Its Joey right?	Yeah.	Wait a minute!	No!	Im the nice one!	Im the one who danced with the kids all night!	HowHow small are your feet?
333	Uhh, do you mind sitting there. Im-Im saving this for my friend Ross.	You mean Dr. Geller?	Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname.	Oh, he wont sit here.	Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
334	Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.	Okay.	Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.	Oh yeah man.  Joey.	Hey.	Oh no its fine, dont worry about it.	Yeah-no, stop apologizing, its okay.	Ill talk to you tomorrow.	I should uh, probably go.	Yeah. Yes! Yeah.	I forgot my purse.	Oh.	No, I really did forget my purse.
335	A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.	I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.	Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.	I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
336	....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?	I spelled out boobies.	Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?	Ah, were out. I sold them all.	What?	No.	No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.	It-it-its no big deal, all right, Im-Im cool.	You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!	Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.	Oh God!	So, how many have you sold so far?	Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!	Oh my God, how did you do that?	Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!	Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.	I am selling cookies by the case.	They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'	Okay, stop what youre doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....	Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?	Me! On my computer.
337	Hi.	Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?	Why not? Its built into the price of the room.	Yeah but you dont needWhat is this?	Thread!	Score! Where are the disposable cameras?	What disposable cameras?	The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?	No you didnt.	Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said	Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.	And then you said, "Why do they call it a check?	Why not a Yugoslavian?"	Yeah, then you did that.	So you dont have the cameras?!	No. Sorry man.	So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak!	Well, Im sure theyre still somewhere here in the hotel. Ill-Ill help you look for them.	Great.	In-in three minutes.
338	Uhh, Rachel, my parents	Ohh! Its so nice to meet you.  Hello.	Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.	What?	This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is notthats-thats not what it is.	See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually.	Its-its, theyre-theyre wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at	Maybe in L.A?	Yes!	There you go.	So, have you kids eaten yet?	Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next.	Well, were starving, why dont we all go get something to eat?	Oh, yeah, well Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin around the house.	So We go eat.	Yes.	Youll wear that. Well be eating, and of course, youll be wearing that.
339	Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!	Thanks.	Enough!	Lean lean lean
340	Let me see that.
341	This one right here.
342	Triskaidekaphobia.	The fear of	No! No, fear of the number 13.	Its possible, they have really sharp edges.	All right Chandler, youre up.	Wait a minute, I-I believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?	This game makes no sense!	Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing.	Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.	All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.	Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care.	You-you must choose Mr. Bing.	Either, it makes no difference.	Choose, you jackass!	Ill take a card.	Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points!	What?!	This game is kinda fun.	You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you	I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
343	Hello?  Oh, hi Ross!  See? Other people call me!
344	Very funny Ross!	Very life-like and funny.	Okay.	Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady.	Whoa, maybe I was!	Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!	Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that.

347	Shoot! Were out of soda.	Oh, Ill go out and get you some.	Really?!	Nope! Because Im not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs, how did it go?	Well, umm, my Moms friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.	I found a dried up seashores.	Sweety, what are you talking about?	Oh, my new Mom, who-whos a big, fat abandoner!	Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Dont you wanna stay here and talk about it?	No. Im just, I wanna, I need to be alone.	Monica!	Oh.
348	Open it! Open it! Open it!	Yeah baby!	So we never got to hear about your wedding!	No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
349	Hey!	Hey!	Hi!	So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant    sometime in the next few weeks?	Sure!	I'd love to!	Well you	Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been    revoked again!	Phoebe, what happened?	Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes    the hand just slips!	Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!	Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
350	Umm, this is nice.	I know, it is isnt it?	No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?	Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.	Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.	Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.	Oh yeah, that sounds great.  Oh, and listen, its, its gonna be....	I know. Thanks.
351	So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!	You got Rachel pregnant?!	Who did?!	You did!	Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.	Oh? Really? Thats what my daughter means to you? Nothing?	No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careI-I love Rachel.	What?!	Oh but not that way. I meanI mean Im not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.	Oh really? Thats how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?	Hey! I offered to marry her!	Wh	But I didnt want to.	Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!	Tramp?!	Im sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
352	Yes, Fran.	I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!...	Oh, really, really, really?	Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it!	You got it?	Good!	Whooooaaaa....
353	Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?	Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
354	I could have birds.	Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.	Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.	All right, bye-bye.	Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.	We'll give you Janice.	I miss Janice though.  "Hello, Chandler Bing."	"Oh, my, god."	"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"	Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.	We won. We won!	Mr. Heckles.	How did this happen?	He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand.	That's terrible.	I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me.	Sure, you coulda. You never know.	You never know.
355	Oh, I'm sorry.	Where's Chandler?	Oh, he needed some time to grieve.	I'm free! I'm free!	That oughta do it.
356	Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.	Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?	Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.	I didn't know there were docks.	Hey.	Hey.	Aww, is it broken?	No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.	Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?	Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.	Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.	What is this? Fruit?	Monica's making jam.	Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?	Because the kids need new shoes.	I'm going into business people.	I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.	I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.	What's the opposite of man?	Jam.	Oh Joey don't!	It's way to hot.	This will just be my batch.
357	Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?	Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.	What? Mine arent tinted.
358	Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?	I will have one.	Okay, Im not gonna have one.	No, no, its just my tooth.	All right Ill have one.	So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.	No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.	See that is the problem with invisible dentists.	Why? Why cant you go to him?	Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.	That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.	Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!	Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.	And all these people actually died?	Yes, while I was in the chair!	Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!	Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.	Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence.	Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead.
359	Hello?	Ross.	It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.	No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called.	Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else.	Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
360	You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.	Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.	So, let's go.	Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.	Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.	You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
361	Okay, Ive got three of my five.	Three of your five, what?	Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.	Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.	Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.	All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?	Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....	Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.	Susan Sarandon.	Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.	And!! Isabella Rosselini.	Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.	So?	So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.	Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
362	Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?	Yknow what I think it is?	I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.	Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!	Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.	Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.	Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.	What?	Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.	My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
363	Are they here yet?	No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
364	Ok.
365	Hi.	May I see your boarding pass?	Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.	Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.	No, I know, but Ihe just went on.	He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...	No no no! Federal regulations!	OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is	Alright. What's the message?	Uh... I don't know.	Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.	What?	It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.	: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!	There's no Rachel!
366	Here's the thing, Janice.	You know, I mean, it's like we're different.	I'm like the bing, bing, bing.	You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.	Ow!	Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?	Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.	I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.	Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?	Oh, I don't know, a million?	Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.	I'm fine.	All right.	I'm not fine. Here she comes.	Wait here. Breathe.	How do you do that?	It's like a gift.	We should always always break up together.	Oh, I'd like that.
367	You win.	Well, what did you have?	It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six.	That my friend is D-Cup.	Okay, now much have you won so far?	Uh,  wow, 700.	Not 700 exactly?	Yeah.	Double it!	What?	Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.	Really?	Hey, I didnt make up the rules.	Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.	Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.	Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!
368	Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.	Presenting Sarah Tuttles Private Very Special Spacecamp!

372	What's wrong, sweetie?	Nothing, nothing.	Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.	It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.	It's my friends.	They-they have a liking problem with you.	In that, um, they don't.	Oh. They don't.	But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.	They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.	They just think you're a little...	What?	Intense and creepy.
373	You got me.	Yeah. Right.	Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
374	I cant believe were here.	Oh youve got to be kidding me.	What?	As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.	No!! You have been screwing us all day!	Who are you?	Were you just ten seconds later!	You already got the first class tickets.. you got the lounge!	I mean we should get free stuff too!	I mean youre not the only ones on your honeymoon!	Well you can have the suite if you want.	We dont care about where we stay.	Were here to celebrate our love together.	We dont have to get free stuff.	We just want to be together.	We need the stuff.
375	Yes!	Okay, well then how about a handshake?	Oh God I'm sorry!	Oh God, I'm sorry!	I did not mean to touch thatI mean
376	Hey Pheebs!	Hey!	Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!	Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.

What?! That-thats all the way cross town, Im supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.	Ooh, dude. Thats not gonna happen.	Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! Im the teacher!!
378	Jason?	Yeah, come on in.	So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
379	No. And I dont think Im gonna want to.	I cant do this.	Yep. Yep, thats what I didnt want to know.	Well, oh, Mark, Im doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?	Im just doing it to get back at Ross.	Im sorry, its not very fair to you.	Ahh!	Fair, shmair	Y'know?	Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you.	Really?
380	No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.	Right here!	Oh God. Im sorry about this.	Thats okay.	You sure?
381	Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
382	Here she is! Future fashion superstar!	Oh Joey, Im hardly a	My little sister Dina!
383	And here we go	I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh.	Yknow it wouldnt kill ya to respect your wifes privacy!	Stupid closet full of bugs!	Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I dontWhoa!!

Yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes	If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?	Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow?	She lives so close.	And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny.	On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.	Hey!	Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?	Damn!
425	Oh heres a whole bunch.	Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl."	Then shell have to come back here and live all alone.

430	Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just dont say anything to Rachel, please?	Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!	Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!	Hey Rach!	What was that?!	Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?

Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!	Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it!

Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
446	So, youre like a zillionaire?	And youre our age. Youre our age.	Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.	What like Pete Dakota?

So ah, we on for tomorrow?	Absolutely!	Now get out of here you!!	Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him!	Look, is there something wrong with me?	I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?	Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!	I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?	No.
447	Okay, Im gonna go get Frank.	So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember?	And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
448	Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?	You know what else Im not gonna miss?	"Im Monica.	I wash the toilet 17 times a day.	Even if people are on it!"	"Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!"	"Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"	Hey! I call her!	"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"	"Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend!	So I guess Ill just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"	Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
449	Item J437-A, color: winterberry.	Hi umm, listen come here, come in.	Im so-so sorry about yesterday.	I-Im really sorry.	Its just that I	Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there.	You do?	Yeah, you still have feelings for me.	And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.	And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.	Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.	Oh God youre right.	Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?	No.
450	Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.	Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it savory.	Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.	Gimme this.	Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist.	Brides magazines?	Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.	Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.	It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.	I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant.	Right?	I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.	Oh my God.	I know.  I need more pie.	Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?	You didnt break up with that fireman?	No, that was my way of telling you.	Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.	He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.	Wow!	Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.	So then, are you going to dump Jason?	Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?	So Its really just about the math.
451	Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.	Ok, look! Enough is enough!	No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!	Monica, that was also true an	I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!	You knew this about me when you married me!	You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.	Well, this is my sickness!
452	Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.	Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.	Yeah me too, all night.	Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?	Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper.
453	I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!	Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker
454	Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.	No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!	Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
455	So.	So.	I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.	I mean, you know, we've never really talked.	I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?	I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.	Really? Me?	Oh my god, are you kidding?	Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.	Well, you're not totally paranoid.	Oy.	Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.	Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?	Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.	I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.	All right, Julie.	Bye.	Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
456	Chandler, I found the perfect ring.	Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.	Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!	What?	Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!	They put you in jail?	The little jail between the doors!	Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!	I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.	Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.	Maybe it was the guy.	It was the ring!
457	No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?	Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.	No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.	Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.	Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.	Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..	We can, we can go to Aruba!	When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.	You would've liked it.	I had a bra.	Hey, Dr. Farber.	All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.	What?!	I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
458	Oh my God! What does
459	Oh that's an eye removal machine.	All right, I'm outta here!	I'm kidding! I'm kidding!	So were done then!	Almost! But first, we gotta start.	This is a glaucoma test.	Uh-huh.	Sit down.	Okay.	But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.	What?!	A small puff of air, now come on!
460	Sure, now Im scared.	No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.	Yeah, but I dont wanna die!	No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
461	Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.	Oh, hey.	Hi.	Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed.
462	Hey!	Hey!	No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.	Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.	Youre building a post office?	No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.	Okay.  My word! Those are snug.	Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.	Power saw kinda got away from me there.
463	Hi!	Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!	So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?	I cant seem to say goodbye.	Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?	Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!	It was cheesecake.	It was fine.	It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!	My whole mouth just filled with saliva!	Yknow what? Forget it!	Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.	Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?	Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
464	This ones from me.	Ahh!	It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.	A scooter!	Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.	No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.	Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!	Okay.	Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?	For my last birthday you gave me a	Okay.	Happy birthday Grandma!	Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.	All our love Monica and Chandler.	Thats funny, yeah!	No-no-no-no! That was the joke!	No, I know! I get it! Its funny!	No, because youre not a grandmother!	No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.	Thats why its so funny.	All you had to do was buy the card!
465	Hey, Joey. What's going on?	Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.	Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!	Sorry. Wrong boobies.	Hello, Joey.	Oh! ...Hello, dear.
466	Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?	I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...	Really?	No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..	Hey, buddy.	Oh, that's attractive.	Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.	Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?	Oh, ah- the kid has it.	The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.	You gotta do it, man.	Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatevercan't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.	Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!	Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!	GIVE ME MY PUCK!!	...Now
467	Oh, look, wish me luck!	What for?	I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
468	Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right?	You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!	What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!	Hi!	Im so glad you could make it.	Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.	Try. Theres my little girl.	Shes still mad.	Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.	Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
469	Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay.	Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
470	Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
471	No, I dont think well be doing that.	Were not gonna do that.	Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare.	Am I interrupting?	Uh yes! Thank you.	Oh. Oh wait no.	Later.
472	Oh uh, Im sorry.	No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
473	Try feeding her again.	I already fed her.	I know, that’s why I said again!	Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants.	Hey.
474	Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.	Oh Monica, we are so sorry.	For what?	Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.	And then for forgetting to invite you to it.	You al-you already had it?	Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.	Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.	We ruined everything.	Ugh	Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!	No, what did, that was really sweet.	And it kinda works out for the best.	What do you, what do you mean?	Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!	I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like!	Surprise	Surprise	Monica.
475	I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!	Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.	Not you guys.	You got it going on!	So, what are we gonna do today?	They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.	Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!	I don't think so!	Why not?	Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!	I'm not always that bad!	Oh,	I punched you...?	And...?	... Phoebe...?	... and...?	I clunked your heads together!
476	Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.	Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.	Yeah.	Hey!	I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.	What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!	Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.	All right. Did everyone get out okay?	Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.	Ohh. What is this?	No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!	Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
477	Hey! How long until Petes fight?	Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.	Hot dog?	Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.	So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?	I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.	Ohh, thats too bad!	No, I-Im saying I liked her.	Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.	Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.	Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?	Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?	Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.	Hey, the fights starting!	Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?	Nine times!	Okay, I had to put on lotion!	But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.	Fights over!
478	Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?	Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.	Hi guys!	Hey!	What are you up too?	Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.	Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.	Yeah, Big Brother.	Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.	Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?	Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!	Eh	Okay well thats good to know.	The Mr. Bowmonts here!!!
479	Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business.	Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.	My friends name is Joey.	Apparently Howies editing now.	Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.	Can you believe that?!	Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!	Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.	No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!	The nerve huh?	Yeah!	Refill?
480	Hey! How you doing?	Good! Good, long time no see.	Like your sweater.	Oh hey, right back at ya.	Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh?	Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?	So whose is it?	Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.	Okay.	He is so weird.
481	You wanna fool around with Joey?	Yeah!	You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!	And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!	Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?	Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.	Who, who are they?	I know them from work.	Both of them?	No, one of them...	Which one?	I don't know, what were the names I just said?	Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.	All right, all right, you're right	What the hell are you cooking!
482	Oh my God! How did you get back here?!	Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?	We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.	Thats not mine.	Yes it is.	How do you know?	The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."	Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!	Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.	Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off!	Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.	Theres a reset button?!	My God!	Why didnt I see that!	Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?	Oh here it is!	Oh!	Ohh, God!
483	Four letters: "Circle or hoop".	Ring dammit, ring!	Thanks.	Hey, you know our phone's not working?	What?!	I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.	I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!	Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.	Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?	Nngghhh!!!!!!!	Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.	"Heating device."	Radiator.	Five letters.	Rdtor.	Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
484	Well, you'll have to wait your turn.	Well, how long do you think it'll be?	Any minute now.
485	Hey, this-  Heyy...
486	Hey.	Hey! Any good mail?	Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.	Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda.	"Benefits lapsed."	Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.	Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.	Let me see that!	All right.	Oh, I cant believe this!	This sucks!	When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow?	And it wouldnt matter.	Now I gotta be careful?	Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.	All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.	Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.	look both ways before you cross the street.
487	I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
488	I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.	I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.	Do you know anything about women?	No.	That's all right.	Okay.
489	Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.	Yeah. He could row like a viking.	Hi.	Mmm.	So how'd it go?
490	Oh, y'know..
491	Did he mention us?	He said he's really gonna miss you guys.	You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
492	...love you.	Are you're hands still wet?	Uh, moist, yeah.	Let's dry 'em again.
493	Oh my God! Oh my God!!	Still crying?	Like a	Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.	Whats the other one?	I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one.	Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.	Oh thats right.	Youre the talker.	Anyway uh, great idea!	Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.	Oh, we have some	No you dont!
494	Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.
495	Yeah, what town are we near?	Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?	Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?
496	Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.	Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?	I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.	Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?	Okay!	Yeah, no they dont do that.	Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.	Who?	I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?	I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.	No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!	But if...	No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.	Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.	So the going for help went well?
497	Im telling you man, I saw it.	Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.	Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?
498	I know.	Lets try a lookof far offwonderment.	Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come.	Chandler!	What is the matter with your face?!	I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"	Hey!	Dont laugh at him!	Hes
499	Were gonna find love!	Definitely!	Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.	Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!	It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.	What do you mean?	Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.	You mean a backup?	Exactly!	Yeah, yeah I got that.	You do?	Hm-mmm	Who?	Yeah!	Are you serious?!	Yeah, I locked him years ago!	Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey.	Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.	Oh, seriously?	Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
500	Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch?	Yeah!
501	Good morning.	Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?	Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.	Ohh thats nice.	Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!	Wo-women? You mean like old women?	Well kinda old, like 30.	Oh.	And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.	Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh?	A little.	Yeah?	How you doin?
502	Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!	I know.	So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
503	What did you just say?	You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.	Are you serious?!	Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.	I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.	Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!	What do you say?	Okay!	Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!	Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?	It went under the table.	Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!	Here it is! Here it is!	That could be a four or a five. It's your call.	It's a four.	I think so too.
504	Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.	Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.	Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.	Is there anything we can do for you?	No just, nobody press on my stomach.	You can keep those pants by the way.	Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?	Yeah, you want some?	Ah, just cut me a little sliver.	A little bigger.	Little bigger.	What?!	Are you afraid youre gonna run out?!	Cut me a real piece!
505	Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?	I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler.	Oh my God!	Of course, of course.	Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?	Umm, do you know each others hometowns?	Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?	Well, umm, not much.	But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?	So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?	Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?	Nothing..Why?	Phoebe, you said it was urgent!	Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.	Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?	Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
506	Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.	Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.	Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.	Your good heart Rach,  and, and....	No.	I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.	I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.	God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.	Its just changed, everything.	Forever.	Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.	Then how come it is?
507	Windows are clean, candels are lit.	Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.	Did I turn the fish?	No, cause I made lasagne.	Am I out of control?	Just a touch.	Mon, I don't understand.	I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?	I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.	What?	Could tonight be the Night?	I don't know.	Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.	Things happen, and they happen.	You don't plan these things.	So, did you shave your legs?	Yeah.
508	Ross!	Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.	Hi!	Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.	Uh-oh.	Is there a problem?	Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.	But that's okay, no problem.	No problem.	Hmm, noodle soup.	Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."	Oh, what did I say?	Hmm, noodle soup.	How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!	All right, let's try one.	Hmm, noodle soup.	Okay. Let's do it again.	Okay.	Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!	COME ON!!!!	Y'know what? We need to move on.	No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
509	Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!	Yeah?	Give her some money.	I really think theyre out of rooms.	Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!	Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are.	Okay.	Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?	This is a hospital.	Yknow what?	Id have to say I really dont care for your tone.	And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa!	Oh gosh!	What-what?	Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!	Would you like to see a semi-private room?	Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.
510	I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.	That's funny. Who are they?	The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.	You mean they're lovers.	If you wanna put a label on it.	Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
511	Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.	Okay, quick and painful.	Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.	Oh, what? What-what?	Y'know Marcel?	...Yeah?	Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
512	Hi Pheebs!	Hi!	How are ya?	Good.	Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?	Yeah.	And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?	Yeah!	And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!	Ooh, now you lost me.	You stole the phone!	No I didnt!	No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?	No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!	Phoebe!
513	Its not here.	Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?	How could I have left them in the copy room?	I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? Its not a perfect world! Just go please.	Fine.

No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.	You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.	Well, here's your phone doctor.
515	Hey guys.	Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?	Well, hes very charming.	I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.	Well, youre just gonna have to try.

521	There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.	I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.	And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.	Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.	And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.	Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry.	Thank you.

Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.	Fine.	Phoebe, what is it?	All right, you know Paolo?	I'm familiar with his work, yes...	Well, he made a move on me.	Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!	More coffee over here, please!
524	Hey.	Hey. What, what are you doing here?	Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.	Yeah,  oh, but oh...	Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....	Destiny.	Sure.	Yes.	All right.	Okay.  Yikes! That one doesnt look very fulfilled.	Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back.	You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.	Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.	So, what happens to the old guys?	Well, they go into the chipper.	Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!	Hey! Hey!!
525	Light still out?	Yeah.	Oh. Maybe they're- napping.	Oh please, they're having sex.	Shut up!	So, whaddya think George is like?	I think he's shy.	Yeah?	Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
526	Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im a big, big fan of yours. I mean,	Arent you with that girl over there?	Well, yeah, kinda.	Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you.	No, no, no, its flattery.	Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.	Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast.	I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...	Yeah, for you. Is that the list?	Um, yeah.	May I see it?	Um, no.	Come on!	But, okay.	Im not on the list!	Um, see, but thats not the final draft.	Its laminated!	Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.	Y'know its ironic...	...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.	Were just gonna be friends.
527	Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!	Hey Pheebs!	Ohh! You made up!	Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.	Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.	Ohh, get a room.	We have one.	I know. Use it.
528	Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!	Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?	Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!	Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!	Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?	Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!
529	Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!	So thats the only reason she could be here huh?	It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a	Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!	I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.	Good-bye.	Whoa!	Uh, that was your sister actually.	She-she thinks that youre just using me.	So?
530	Im sorry.	What are you doing here?!	I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.	What?!	Umm, okay, okay, look.	I took this picture from your fridge.	Okay, because I know that this is my Father.	Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.	Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.	All right?	So if you can help me find my Father then you should!	Otherwise, youre just mean!	So, just tell me the truth!	All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.	My Father is Chuck Magioni?	No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!	And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.	Oh.	But umm, youre right.	I think that a person should know where they come from.	Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.	Im your mother.	Heh?	Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
531	Whats happening to your accent?	Come again?	Whats-whats this nonsense?	All right, Im-Im not English.	Im from Long Island.	I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.	Im sorry.	So, if we could just get back to the lecture.	Umm, were there any questions?	About paleontology.	All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.	Obviously, I screwed up.	But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.	So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression	Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am	Well, hello Rachel!
532	Where you going, Joe?	For a walk.	Oh. You mind if I join you?	Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.	Your thoughts? Plural?	Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!	I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.	Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??	You guys are killing me!	She's forbidden fruit!	It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?	Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?	Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.	Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.	Great novels?	Fine ... mediocre porn
533	Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.	Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.	Thats kinda sad.	Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,	Got it!	Lets roll!	Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?	Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.	Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you.	Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
534	Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?	Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.	Oh! No problem! I	What?
535	You are iron.	You are steel!	Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?	I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
536	I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!	Look, you and I went to different high schools...	Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.	You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.	I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.	They had to have that specially made?!	It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.	Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!	Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.	And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.	I-I owe her this.	I never let her eat.	Oh, you go out with him.	Oh, really?!	Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?	Ill try.
537	Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with.	Yeah, yeah, okay.	Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..	Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh, mellow!	Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
538	Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.	Yeah but	Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.	Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!	Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!	Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!	Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?	Sure!	He got it a flea market!	You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
539	And Joey?	How do you think she's doing?	Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?	Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....	Thank you!	Now that Rachel's gone?	So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
540	Oh, god help us.	What?	Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!	Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.	I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
541	So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.	Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.	Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.	What do you mean?	Carol our sex life isits just not working	Hey there little fella!	Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes on ya, huh?	Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!	Yay!	Yay!	Yay!	Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I dont know, we could try some-some new things.	For fun?	Like what?	Well I dont know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?	Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.	Nah!	Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk?	Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.	I love that idea!
542	So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?	Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.	Oh my God, they took my idea!	That was you?!	Yeah! Okay, here you go.	Rachel, I made you a cocoa.	Oh my God, are you guys okay?	Are you all right?	Oh my.
543	Sit!	Hi.	Oh my gosh, Joshua!
544	All those things I said about not being ready	Theyre not true?	No, theyre-theyre all true.	Oh.	But	Oh! Oh, I love that but.	You wanna go inside and have some coffee?	Yeah.	Okay.  Every time.
545	What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!	Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.	Why would we do that?	Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.	Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.	Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!	The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.	The balloon?	No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached	I can't, I gotta go.	Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?	Almost never.	Got the keys?	Ok.
546	What d'you think?	Lot of things.	Which one do you think she is?	May I help you?	Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.	You don't observe a dance class. You	What does she mean?	I think she means  'You	Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?	People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!	She could be you.	Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...	Okay, I'm not getting this!	I'm totally getting it!	Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?	What? You just click when they click.	Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.	Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.	Great. It's gym class all over again.
547	I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.	Nooo, it wasn't.	Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
548	Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.	I know	Open your drapes! Open your drapes!	I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!	The sun is out!	Hey! Remember when I had corneas?	Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.	Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.	Walls are pretty thin, guys!
549	Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect Id like to donate some fluids.	Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now.	Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?	Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up.	Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.	Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. Its a twins study.	But its $2,000.	Sorry.	Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.	We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not good.
550	Hey! Hows it goin?
551	Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.	Yes it has! I made cookies!	Oh thats all right. Im still full from your homemade potato chips.	But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.	Okay.	Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies!	Okay, Ill be out in a second.	Okay!	What are you doing?	That doesnt lock does it?
552	You know, it still smells like monkey in there.	That saves us a conversation.	Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.	Me too, we should get goin'.	No.
553	Okay, here comes another camera.	Right. No biggie. Stay loose.	Why do they keep doing that?	If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms.	Theyve been taping those people up there all day.	Right.	Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?	Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?	Yeah!	Hey! Youre a good dancer!	Really?	Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.	What do you mean?	Like this.	Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better.	Uh-huh.	Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there.	No-no-no-no-no we came together!	I dont see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!	No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.	Really, ythink so? I dont..
554	Why arent you home yet?!	Is someone there?	Oh yes, its me! Sorry!	What are you doing here?	Uh, Im just, Im just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?	We got some	Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.	Who?  Is that your sister?	Ugh, she	God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!	Oh my God, look-look hes taking off her clothes!	Hes taking off her coat!	Oh, this is just terrible.
555	Ross! Wait!	Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about	You suck!!	What?!	Okay, break-ups still on!
556	Hey.	Hey.	Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.	No, I dont want to hit you.	Oh what then? Kick me?	No.	What do I do?
557	Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.	Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.	Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.	Oh.	Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.	Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend	Sure!	Horny bitch.  No! Youre a horny bitch! Noooo! Youre the horny bitch! No! Youre a horny bitch!
558	Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!	Well, like father, like son.	Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.	Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.	Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?	Ummmmmmmm, no.	You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!	Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
559	Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.	Oh, yeah. Had that dream.	Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.	Instead of...?	That's right.	Never had that dream.	No.	All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
560	Honey! Dinners ready!	Whats my little chef got for me tonight?	Your favorite!	Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!	Yep! And lots of it!	Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.	Okay, in we go.	Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin?
561	Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.	So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.	Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?	Oh my god.	What?	Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.	Come on, they're close.	Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.	Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.	Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?	Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...	Oh my god, what were you thinking?	All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.	Oh!	Ow!	I'm outta here.	Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.	Really?	Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
562	Hello! One marriage please!	Yep, we wanna get married!	All right.	Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!	What are you doing?	Oh, that's	No, only because that's the graduation song.	Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married!	Are you sure you wanna do this?	Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!	Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!	Wait!  Okay!
563	Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?	It depends on who asked.	What if I asked?	Oh, Mon, sure.	Really?	Yes.  Youre not asking are you?	No.	Yes! Totally!	Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
564	Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?	He asked you out?!	No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.	Saucy!	What are these?	Electrical plans for the building.	Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?	I know that switch does something, okay?	So-so I went down to city hall and got these.	All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.	Wow! If only more people knew.
565	Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in	Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.	So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.	Oh, nobody's judging you.	Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
566	Oh man!	I want that place so much!!

With the inappropriate and the pinching!!	Actually, I did!	Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?	Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!	Are you serious?	Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!	Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!
569	Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.	All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.	No, let's just leave the lights on.	Oh my God!
570	You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?	Oh fine.	Ready?  Wrestle!	Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
571	All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.	Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!	Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.	All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke.	Steady.	Steady.	Okay, a little higher.	Careful of the angle.	Okay, okay, were approaching the window  Thread the needle.	Thread the needle.	Hes alive! Hes a-live!!!	And yet, were still poking him.	Okay, retract the device, retract the device.	He does not look happy.	Hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device.	Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!

The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.	But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!	No-no-no-no-no! You can't!	Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.	All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's	I know, it's great!	Aww, I don't want to see that!	We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
575	And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.	Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?	No Cobb, as in cobb salad.	Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
576	What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?	Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.	Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?	You got a better idea?	All right, call it in the air.	Heads.	Heads it is.	Yes! Whew!	We have to assign heads to something.	Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.	What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
577	Okay, some tricks of the trade.	Now, Ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.	Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that Ive just done something evil.	That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it  Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.	And thats how its done.	Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.	Hey, Mr. Trib.	Hey-hey.
578	Then Im gonna have to ask you to keep it down.	Who are you?	Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate.	Im Chandlers new roommate.	I-I-I dont think so.	I could be Chandlers new roommate.	But, he told me over the phone.	He told me in person.	Thats weird.	Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh!
579	Hey! Look who I found!	Oh, hey guys!
580	Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.	Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
581	Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas?
582	Didnt think so!
583	Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!	Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?	Hmm, how about my azzz?	Hey, this is hollow.	What?	This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!	No, dont look directly at them!	What?	Alright, no, we could look at them!	I
584	Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. I-I wished youd called first.	Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your father.	Oh good.	I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.	Okay, whats up?	I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.	Ma, youre asking me to marry you?	This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.	Mom no, come on! Thank you.	Just hear me out!
585	Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus.	I cant believe this!	I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross.	Youre, youre really, youre so good.	Thanks.	And youre so sweet.  And youre kind	Thanks.	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.	Okay, its okay.	Wait, wait, wait.	My foot is stuck in the pocket.	What?	No, I cant get it out.
586	Rachel?
587	Yeah.  Hi Mark!	Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.	Oh, I did!	Yes.	Oh my God!!	Congratulations...oh..wow
588	I cant believe I did this! What an idiot!	Oh, stop beating yourself up!	People make mistakes!	These things happen!	There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there?	Apparently youre not very good at it!	I
589	Philadelphia.	Oh my God! So was she! Oh, Ive got-Ive got goose bumps.	Really?	Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm.	Yeah.	But ifno look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!	Did you hear that?!	I dont need you guys to care about me!	Because the universe cares!	The whole universe!	I really wished theyd care just a little bit though.
590	I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and thats why I have to kill you."	They cant all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.	Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?	Do you really want to pull at that thread?	Im having a really good time!	Me too! Im sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.	Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend.	Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?	Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so Id just be lost.	I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss andOh no! No! No! My God!	Okay, dont freak out. Ill go.	No its Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!	Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?	Yeah?	Yeah, umm thats Whitney , Kyles ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can yknow divert her so that we can slip out?	What?! No!	Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.	Look, I dont think so Pheebs.  All right, Ill do it. But just because youre a friend.
591	Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?	I'll take sports.	Mine!	All right. Uhh, international.
592	Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say	You two will have very hairy children.	Okay, I didn't know you would say that.	Ross! Janice?!	All right, hold on!	Hold on.	Hold on.	This is Ross, okay?	He's our friend.	He obviously went crazy.	He obviously lost his mind.	So are you actually gonna see her again?	Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!	Damnit Phoebe!!
593	Hey, dont we have to...	Yeah, we got, um-hmm.	Umm, I think youre really, really great...	Oh God!	Here we go again.	Why does this keep happening to me?	Is it something Im putting out there?	Is this my fault?	Or am I just nuts?	I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say.	Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
594	Wait!	Terry!	Please!	Look, I just lost my other job.	Okay?	You have no idea how much I need this.	Please, help me out, for old times sake.	This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its hopeless.	Its not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramorays a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.	Good morning.  Drake, its your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?	Im back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
595	That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.	Well you did pull his hair.	He took my snack!	Im not getting into this again!	Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.	Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.	This doesnt mean anything, does it?
596	Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?	That is true.	Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.	Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.	Joey, you know you dont actually have one.	Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her!	Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.	All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.	What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting!	The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!	But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team! Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me!	Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.	But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.	I think thats gum.	Im pretty sure its gun.	Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.	A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?	That was the only way I could get him to	Hi! How are the Gellers?	Dont call us that!	The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?	Hey! Its Porsche!!
597	Hey sweetie!	Hey!	Theres no back to this couch!	Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.	Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow?	Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside.	Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.	Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.	Stop it!	No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this.	I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.	Yeah?
598	Of course he is!	What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an excuse?	What kind of father do you think I am?	All right, sorry.	I gotta go make a fake Ben.
599	The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!	Well, either that or uh	Joey!!	Yeah?	Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!	Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!	Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!	They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!!	Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it.	Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!	Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a	Sure!	Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldnt stop thinking about it.	I mean, everyone should have a-a	Oh my God Ross!!	You like it?	I	Yeah?
600	Hello darlings.	And theres daddy!
601	There he is! There he is!	Where?	Right- where we've been looking all night!	He is so cute!	Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!	Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop thewowww.
602	I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.	Yeah, isn't he?	It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.	You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.	Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.	Huh. That's nice.
603	and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for	Eight whole days.	Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.	Awesome!	Yeah?	My favorite part was when	The Armadillo was actually not so	Hey!	Oh.	Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunnys funeral in here.	Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles!	Oh.	Oh.	Okay, I understand why
604	Yeah, sure. Good luck!	Im quitting!! Woo-hoo!  Im okay!! Im all right!!	Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.	What?	Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?	Why would you say that?	Cause youre still into Monica.	So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...	Youre good. Youre good!	Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift.	Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?	Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?	Thanks a lot.	No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks.
605	Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.	For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!	Oh, hey, hey, I got that.	Oh, thanks, sweetie.	No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.	Really?	You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?	No, no, they will. I just... uh...	Can't wait.
606	Do I know you?	Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?	Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.	You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.	Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.	Uh, wait, backstage?	Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.	Ross.	Chandler.	Look, you guys wanna meet the group?	Come on.	So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
607	Do you have any respect for your body?	Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?	Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.	The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.	Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.	Really?	He does?	Hey, buddy, what's up!	Oh, she told you about that, huh.	Well, yeah, I have one now and then.	Well, yeah, now.	Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.	Well, okay, thanks!	God, he's good.	If only he were a woman.	Yeah.
608	Oh, look look look.	The last candle's about to burn out.	10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....	Thank you.	Thanks.	Kinda... spooky without any lights.	Bwah-hah-hah!	OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...	Oh.. oh... oh.	Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
609	All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
610	You blew them away!	Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!	I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?	I was	No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!	Oh my God!  I'm your	I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!	Look, I took it too far!
611	Okay, Monica: Right foot red.	Could've played	Thanks.	Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.	Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the	Oh, okay. Will you take my place?	Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.	Nooo!	Hello?	Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.	Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.	Green. To the green.	I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.	To the left, to the left- aww!	Ohhh... I'm fine.
612	Hey!	Please tell me you got the message!	What message?	The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock.	What?! Its 6 oclock!	Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!	I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!	I went to Rosss!	I went to the coffeehouse!	I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
613	Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day.	Thats what you think.	Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?	Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.	What was her name?	Nestley Toulouse.	Nestlé Toll House?	Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.	Yes!!  Oh.	I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!	I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!
614	So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?	Absolutely!	I am so on board!	Rachel didn't you just light that?	Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.	I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.	Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like	Tell me about it!	Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!	It does sound appealing.	Oh, I never could do it.	Oh but you could.	You can.	Absolutely!	We can help each other out!	We can get--what are those--those patches!	We could be like the Patch Sisters!	Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!	Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!	My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.	Okay then!
615	Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?	Does, um, anyone wanna see?	Nooo..	Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!	It's worse than the thumb!	Hey, this is so unfair!	Oh, why is it unfair?	So I have a flaw!	Big deal!	Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?	And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?	And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?	I mean, what the hell is that thing?	...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?	...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?	Well, I-I could live without it.	Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?	Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.	Oh,  "you do, do you"?	You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.	"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.	Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.	Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
616	Awww! Mel Torme died.	Joey, that papers like a year old!	Aw! Does that mean the	Hey.	Hey.
617	You're sure? You're absolutely sure?	Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.	Probably?	Yeah, I don't like that word.	Kind of what probably really means.	Yeah, uh-huh.	Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow?	I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"	You gotta take care of yourselves!	In	Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
618	Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.	Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?
619	Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?	Oh, Im fine.	Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.	Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.	Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?	Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!	Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.	Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.	Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
620	And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
621	Hey. Whos that?	New people.	What happened to the Disgustingtons?	Theyre having their baby!	Its not fair Ross we got here first!	Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.	Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.	Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
622	Phoebe?	Yeah?	Look at that guy by the window, wow!	Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.	Oh, what is wrong with me lately?	I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.	Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.	Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?	Yeah.	This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.	Really?! So this has happened to you?	Oh absolutely yeah!	Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.	Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.	Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a
623	Ugh!	I dont know what Im going to do!	I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!	Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?	Hey guys!	Hey!	Hey	I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!	And the guys from work had a blast.	Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.	Yeah!	And-and another one had never been to a party before, so	So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!	Yeah, right!	I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those	That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.	So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?	Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.	So you might say, its a magic ring.
624	OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
625	Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.	Obviously! So, how do we decide?	Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.	Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her	Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction	Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.	Yeah well we should order some food then.	No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well	That sounds fair.	Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street	Ah yeahwait a second now!	Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.	I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.	Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.	All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.	So lets decide on the spending limit	Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?	I was thinking more like a hundred.	Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
626	Hi, again.	Hey!	Hey!	Thank you soo, much.	Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.	You want some help with that?	Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!	Whoa! Are you okay?	Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.	Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.	Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.	Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?	Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.	What do you mean?
627	Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
628	Oh!	Hey, somebody left their keys.	Ooohh, to a Porsche!	Hey Gunther, these yours?	Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!	Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?	Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?	Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!	You left a shoe here?!	Well, I didnt realize until I got home.	I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!	Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.	Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.	Great! Thanks.
629	Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.	Carol, we've been through this before, ok?	We have a good time.	We laugh, we play.	It's like we're father and son.	Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.	Oh, this is so cute.	Oh, I got that for him.	My mommies love me. That's clever.	Hello?	Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew!	Uh huh?	Uh huh?	Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.	See ya then.	Bye.	Did you just say Hi, Jew?	Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
630	Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!	Thanks Monica!	Does that smell bother you?	What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.	Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.	I can smell it a little, bake the pie.	Okay!	Okay.	Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.	Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!	Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.	No-no, it was the candles.	Its very not good leaving candles unattended.	In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.	Well, I have to go now.
631	Joey proposed to me.
632	Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!	Well, I-I said yes.	What?!	Are you crazy?	You just had Ross’s baby!	It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.	No, it’s worse than that.	It’s wrong.	It’s… It is bigger than  mine!	I know.	You can’t marry him!	Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.	Well do you love him?	Sure.	Sure?	Yeah, I mean whatever.	Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?	No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
633	So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?	Here comes the bride.	Oh my God Monica!	I wanna wear this everyday.	You look so beautiful.	Im so happy for me.	Hello?	Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?	Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.	Damnit!
634	I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?	Fine.	Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.	And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!	No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I	Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!	And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!	Crap!!	I gotta go!
635	Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?	No.	Me neither! We have to get in!	Just act like you belong.	Oh my God! Oranges!	Shh!  Nice to see you again.	Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?	Yes, of course.	Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.	Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
636	Okay!	Yknow what?	I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.	All I really needed was a plan.	See I wanna have three kids	Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.	As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.
637	You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!	Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,	Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!	Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?	I dont know.	Why am I not surprised?	Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!	I dont think you have much choice.	Well well see!	Bye-bye!	Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?	Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
638	Dad?	Im here!	Hey!	Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.	Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.	Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.	Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.	Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.	Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories	Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven	I used to	Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.	Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a
639	Ok, got the vent open.	Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!	Ben, you ready?	All right, gimme your foot.	Ok, on three, Ben.	One, two, three.	Ok, That's it, Ben.	What do you see?	Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.	Phoebs, It's open! It's open!	Wait! You forgot your legs!
640	You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.	Thank you.	Filing system?	Oh-oh!	You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?	It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.	Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.	I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.	Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.	Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost	I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.	Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!	Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.	Yes, I realize that	And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.	I love working with designers!	With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?
641	Chandler, you have an assistant right?	Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
642	Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.	I do?	Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.	Okay.	Or not.
643	Where's Chandler?	Here I am.	Wash your hands!!!	How did youknow?	Hey! What's she doing back here?	Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!	Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
644	What happened in Atlantic City?!	Well, Chandler and I are in a bar	Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"	And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?	So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.	Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.	You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.	In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.	Oh Mon, I laughed so hard	Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?	Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
645	So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?	Of course I am!	Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.	Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.	And-and then guess what?	The babys coming and I dont know what to do.	Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?	No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.	Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?	Im going to the bathroom.	Okay.	Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.	It	Hey!	Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?	I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.	Not if you were here.
646	Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.	Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!	I hope its you.	Me too!	First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me	Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!	Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.	Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine	Yes!!! Oh!!	Hypothetically!	Still.	If Phoebe were my maid of honor	Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.	Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.	Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?	Well thats the best part. Umm,	Wh-why is that the best part?	Because then I dont have to!	Well of	Im really not deciding!	Fine!	Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
647	If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?
648	It's not just the drum noise.	Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!	Oh god, my eye!"	I mean, it is so annoying.	Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.	Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?	Maybe on some level.
649	Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?	No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.	Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.	And, a brownie!	Well, half a brownie.	Actually, its just bag.	Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so	Oh man!	This is so great!	I actually feel like Im going on a real date!	Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere.	Hey come on now, this is a real date.	Uh, sonice place you got here.	Foosball, huh?	Pizza box.	Oh, a subscription to	Yeah, actually thats my roommates.	I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.	Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.	Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?	Hm-mmm	Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?	Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.	No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
650	Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?	Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.	Ha. Ha, ha.	What?	Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.	Please! I am not as bad as Ross.	Oh, I beg to differ. The	That was	Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
651	Well, not playing raquetball!	He forgot to leave his grip size!	He didn't get the goggles!	Well,sounds like you two have issues.	Goodbye, baby.	Ciao, bela.	Do they wait for me to do this?	So are you gonna tell him?	Why would I tell him?	How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.	What are you guys doing here?	Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!	...What did I ask?
652	God. I feel violated.	Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?	Ross, ten o'clock.	Is it? Feels like two.	No,	There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!	Oh. Hel-lo!	She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!	Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.	Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'	Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!	Oh please, could she	He could never get a woman like that in a million years.	Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.	You could do that!	You think?
653	OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.	OK.	This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?	Thank you Helen, that'll be all.	Last time I do that, I promise.
654	I am so, so, so, so sorry!	Uh-huh.	And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!	Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?!	Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please?	Okay.	Okay.	So, are we going in there?	I am!!
655	Wow!	It actually is in the handbook.	I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office.	I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.	For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.	I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.	Wow!	What?	Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.	Really?	Yeah.	Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong.	Stop it!	No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its naughty. Its taboo.	Shut the book!	Lets also get a hot plate!
656	Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends
657	Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?	Oh Im not, I just like to try these on.	I do the same thing.	Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25	Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December.	So when are you getting married?	Oh May 15	Oooh its getting close!	So uh, whos your photographer?	Jeffrey	We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?	The best man? Wow!	I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!	Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.	Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.	Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great!	Oh yknow what?	Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off.	This place is so overpriced.	So, does this  come in another color or
658	I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.	It was unbelievable!	We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...	So have you called her yet?	Let her know I like her?	What are you, insane?	It's the next day!	How needy do I want to seem?	I'm right, right?	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.	I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.	Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!	Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.	Her answer machine?	No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.	So, uh, why didn't you say anything?	Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."	Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!	Okay, okay, what's going on?	Okay, they're just talking...	Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
659	So, um, what do you do for a living?	Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.	Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.	I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.	Now that is funny.	Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?	Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.	I guess.	Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?	Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.	Come on.	These people'll scooch down.	You guys'll scooch, won't you?	Let's try scooching!	Come on.	Come on.	Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.	Carol, Kristin.	Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.	And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
660	Okay.	When I was six years old.	Hm-mm	I wanted a big wheel.	And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.	It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.	That was a pretty tough year.	Thats-thats great!	See?	I already feel like I know you a little better!	Thank you.	Okay, come on.	Now we can go eat.	Lets go.	It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.	Oh!
661	Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?	That's patio furniture!	So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!	What about the birds?	I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."	You pick one.	All right, how about the ladybugs?	Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!	Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!	Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!
662	Bijan for men?	Bijan for men?	Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.	Oh, actually I sorta have plans.	Ready, Annabelle?	You bet.  Maybe some other time?	Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!
663	That was amazing!	Phoebe and Gary are	That was amazing.	We are the hottest! Huh?	No, you're the best.	No, you're the best.	No, you're the best.	I	Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'?	Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
664	So what are you gonna do?	What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.	Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.	Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?	Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!	Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.	Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.	Why? What happened to him?	Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
665	It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.	Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.	Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.	Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.	Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"	Um-hmm, five actually.	Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?	We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.	Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!	Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?	Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.	Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.	Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.	Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.	So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.	Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a	No, Im sorry.	Wow! You guys really dont know anything!	I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
666	Hey!	Hey!	You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!	Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!	Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!	I don't know, clean places?	Mm, yum!	It's Danny.	Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.	We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?	What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!	The fake kind!	Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?	We have a ladle.	Thanks, see you at the party.	Okay, great!	Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
667	You're so efficient. I love you!	Let's go!	No-no-no! We need something old!	Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.	That'll work!	I don't think so.	Okay, now we just need something borrowed!	Here justtake this.	That's stealing!	No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
668	Ohh.	Okay, one thing at a time.
669	Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?	Oh, not much. I-I got a job.	Oh, that's great.	Why are- why are you so tanned?	Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.

Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?	Nope. Going to the	Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!	No, it is me!	Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!	Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.	I'm- I'm Monana!	Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.	Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.	What?	They've arrested Monica.
671	Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.	Now, do you have any idea what you just said?	No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!	Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.	I just...	I wrote that out phonetically for you.	Phonetically?	Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.	Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!	Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".	Wow. What does	No idea!	But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".	Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?	Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .	Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't	Come on! you...	No!
672	Oh.  Oh-oh.	Hey!  What happened to you? Why didnt you come up?	Done!	You just finished?	Well, I wanted to be thorough.	I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!	And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!	So umm, does it?	Im sorry.	Does it?	Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance.	What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!	Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even	No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont	Are you sure?	Oh, sure! Im sure.
673	You got married again.	Yes.	So thats your second marriage in two years.	Yes, second in two years. Third overall.	Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.	Why dont you tell me what happened.	Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk	Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?	Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do	Oh, thats better then.	This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.	I see. Have you considered therapy?	I think just the	There are a couple of forms to fill out.	Easy.	And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.	No problem.	And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.	Ooh!	Theres no way to do this without her?	Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
674	So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.	But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.	Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.	What?	Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.	That's alright, I'll take it.	Bad things happen to me anyway.	This way I can break 'em up with a movie.	Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
675	You wanna do it right now?	Great!	Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from	No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from	Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.	You're welcome.
676	is for me not to see you anymore.	That's crazy!	You can't do that!	What are you going to tell her?	Oh God.	Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?	It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.	And I do, I have to make	Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That	You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.	Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.	What are you doing?	Storming out!	Rachel, this is your apartment.	Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
677	These little women. Wow!	Your liking it, huh?	Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jos manuscript. I dont see how he could ever forgive her.	Umm, Jos a girl, its short for Josephine.
678	Chandler.	Hi.	Hi.	Joey.	Hey-hey!	Hey.	This is Monica.	Whoa!	And this is Rachel.	Hi!	Whoa!!	Im gonna get coffee.	Hey, how do you guys get anything done?	We dont, really.	Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?	Oh yeah! Yeah, no, were gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.	Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.	And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.	You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.
679	Okay, Chandler!	Okay.	And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."	Oh, well thank you in advance.	Op, but the twelfth brings a lovers spat.	Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.	Hey guys!	Hey!!	Oh my God! Its Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!	Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?	Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? Ive dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!	No! Joey, youre going to be great!	But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anything about technology!	I cant even use Chandlers computer except to find porn!	And-and thats only cause its right there when you turn it on!	I think our lovers spat will start a little early this month.	Ill be waiting.
680	Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?	Oh my God! It sure didnt look this way when I lived here.	I know!	Now look, theres only one problem though.	Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.	Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.	Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no ones fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.	Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.	Okay!	So Rach!	Youre the first guest at Hotel Monica!	Umm, youll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.	And I thought I would bring them to you, yknow, in bed.	Oh, you have been through so much.	I have.
681	This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.	Sorry, that was wax.	Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.	Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?	During a blackout? He'd get trampled!	Yeah?
682	Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.	But I'll still always come back, like this.	And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.	But I'll still always come back, like this.	And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.	He is so amazing.	Oh, I know. Look at him.	Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.	Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.  Look, he's opening his eyes.	He doesn't do much, does he?	No, this is pretty much it.	You guys wanna get some coffee?	Yeah.	All right, I'll see you guys later.	Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
683	Come on, they're gonna love you.
684	Well, thank you for lunch.	What? Wait a minute, I didnt pay, I thought you paid!	So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?

Im sorry too.	Really?	Yeah! Oh yes!	Ohh.	Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.	Thats a great idea! We can
764	Totally!
765	We dont have to come up with this now.	Oh good.
766	Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.	Thats great. Good for you guys.	I am not high maintenance!	I am not a pushover!	Who said you were?	You did!	Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything.
767	Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.	That does not sound stupid to me.	You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?	I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.	Next on Ross... Uh-oh.	What uh-oh?	Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.	It's, uh, it's a song.	The laundry song that we sing.	Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.	Ross, what's the matter?	Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
768	Why are you here?	Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...	No no no... I mean,	Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in    a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .	What!?	This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!	I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date...	Please... go!  Just let me know if you    need a hand!	I think it just fell off.
769	I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!	And I just want a million dollars!	Rachel?!
770	Yeah.	Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!	And we're not a couple of suckers!	I hear ya, Mugsy!	But look, all these rooms are fine okay?	Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.	Okay,	Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!	Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?	Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?	Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!	Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?	I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!	Do not speak ill of the dead.	We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?	I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.	What did you say?	I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
771	Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again.	Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Yknow, technically we still	Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in a bit?	Kay!	Can I ask you something?	Uhh, no.	Felicity and I, were watching	No.	I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yknow, you think Ill ever get there?	Yes.	Thanks man.	Okay man.	But what about how much taller he is than me?	I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow?	And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?	Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.	I know!	Had the beef-tips, huh?
772	Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.	Not so fast Wesley!	Ramoray!	Thats right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, youre not a real doctor! And that womans brain, is fine!	Oh! Thank God!	Hope! Hope!	Drake!	Youre not dying Hope, youre gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.	Oh Drake.	Okay!	Here we go!	Okay!	Hi, Joey!	Its Rachel!	Umm, I am free tomorrow night.

774	Mom, would you relax.	That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that.	Mom, c'mon, stop worrying.	This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing	Hi.	Hi, hi can I help you?	Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?	Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.	Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.	What?	Hey, how, how did you do that?
775	Alright, somebody.	OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.	Whoooaa!	That's my sister.	OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.	Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?	Pheebs, what about you?	Oh... Milwaukee.	Um... Ross?	Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'	No way!	The ride broke down.	So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.	Oh, Rachel.
776	Hey!	Hey!	Oh, is the play over?	Yeah. Where were you?	Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.	You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.	Nah. I kept myself busy.	Oh, okay, yeah.  I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
777	Well theres yore. And uh, yknow, yesteryear.	Yeah no, Im telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff.	Ross, yknow if you ever decide you need to redecorateAnd I think that you should.	You should, you should ask Rachel to help.	Oh honey he doesnt need my help.	Oh, come on! I think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.	Really?!	Hey, yknow what?	Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.	Yknow what? I dont, I dont think Phoebe really wants to come.	No! I do want to!	Oh, she does want to.	She does want to.	Yeah!
778	Wow, you have really pretty feet.	These old things.	Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, its been killing me today.	You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.	Yeah.	Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get yknow, real  nice and tight.	So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.	Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.	Oh.	Ow! Did you just bite me?	No!
779	Um, that's it.	No.
780	Crew guy.	Yeah.	Why have you been following me?	I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.	You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....	What?	One more chance Ursula, please?	Okay.
781	Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.	Good deal.
782	Here you go.	Thank you.	Hi!	Hi! All right, lets go shoppin!!	Um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something I need to say.	Oh, okay.	Ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.	But since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it.	But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime.	So-so thats-thats what Im doing, now.	Wow! Umm....	I dropped a cup.
783	Hello, tiny embryos.	Well, Im-Im Phoebe Buffay, hi!	Im-Im-Im hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months.	You should know, that were doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, youve been there!	Umm, yknow they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on.	Okay, and-and I promise that Ill keep you safe and warm until youre ready to have them take you home, so Oh!	And also, umm next time you see me, Im screaming, dont worry, thats whats supposed to happen.	Ready?	Uh-huh.  Good luck.
784	Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.	Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so
785	I'm not your brother.	What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!
786	Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.	Are you kidding me?!	It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!	I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!
787	Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.	Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"	Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?	Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.	Is there something wrong?	All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay?	You're hot.	I'm lovable.	Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.	But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.	Joey...
788	Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im	Ho-oh, hes gonna get some!	Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment.	Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister.	Well, Im off to bed!
789	You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!	Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.	No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!	Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk.	Okay?	Umm, look I like you.	I-I really do, I like you a lot.	Okay?	But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very	Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
790	Oh, Joey! Sorry!
791	They made you head of the department!	No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didnt I get head of the department?	Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm	Yeah.	I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?	Uh, Pauls Café. They got great food and its really romantic.	Ooh, great! Thanks!	Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the	You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya	Ooh, I miss dating.	Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.	Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!	I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.	Hey, yknow what?	Huh?	Why dont I take you out?	What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.	Yes I do!	And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out	Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya.	Ill be fun.	All right?
792	Hi!	Hey!	Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking	Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good	God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!	Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?	Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.	Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.	Oh screw her, that part is mine!	Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.	Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.	I can't believe you married him.	But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a	So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.	It's over! You	How can I?	Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?	How can I accept that...	I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.	Kiss me.	What?
793	Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?	The bigger half.	I'd like to propose a toast.	Little toast here, ding ding.	I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.	Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?	So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.	That's so sweet.	And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.	And a crappy New Year.	Here, here!
794	Now, hold on!	Hold on!	Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that Im gonna be at that airport and I hope that shell be there too!	Oh yeah, I said Rachels name, but it didnt mean anything, Okay?	Shes-shes just a friend and thats all!	Thats all!	Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.	Please, promise me that youll tell her that.	All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face!	Call me.	You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window!
795	What happened?!!	Well, I dont know!!	We fell asleep! That is all.	Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go.	I think that would be best.	Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later.	Okay. But not about this!	No! Never! Never!  Bye.	No touch! No touch!
796	Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.	What?	It’s a funny story, actually.	I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really  know what I was saying.	You fell asleep?	But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?	Irony?	Not a fan, alright .	See, here’s  the thing.	I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go.	See, me, I  love Tulsa!	Tulsa is heaven!	Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go  there!	Chandler, I…	No no no!	Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?	Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine?	Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping!	That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it,  well she’s lovely.	I like a girl with a strong jaw.	I’ll call you from Tulsa.
797	Hi.	Hey.	How are you?	I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?	Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.	That I was not expecting.	I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.	Oh. Thanks.	No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing	Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.	I just can't believe you're in here.	I mean, what am I gonna do without you?	Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?	Who's gonna take me to the
798	Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.	What do you mean?	Smell familiar?	Oh no.	Oh, I am so sorry.	No me, I am so sorry...	Oh my.
799	Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.	Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.	Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.	Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?	My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.	No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.	Tho?
800	Ohhh.	That's good, have a seat.
801	Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.	You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?	Can you do that for me?	Ok.	Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?	Yes!	All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.	Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!	Let go of my hand!
802	Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!	Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!	Welllets just say	Oo, where are the seats?	Uh, middle balcony.
803	Youre a mean old woman.	No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook!	Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?	Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me.	Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity!	Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!	That means nothing to me.  Come on!
804	Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.	: What are you doing?	Ummm. Oh! Im sorry.  Its a little old but	: No! Youre clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!	Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot.	: Oh yeah, of course you dont!	: Cause youre a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of	: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?	Well, why dont think of someone else for a change?	Okay, Im sorry.
805	Hello!	What's this?	Oh right its that girl's phone number.	Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me.	It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa!	Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!	Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.	Thank you.
806	I dont know how any of these got opened?!	You opened them all?	I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!	Oh hey! You got my parents gift!	Yeah. What is that?	Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami.	Hey! Howd it go?	Yeah. What-what did Tag say?	Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?	I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.	Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra!	So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?	No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight.	Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youre not gonna be alone in this.	Im not?	Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom.	Yknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.	So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?
807	Thank you.	If I cant have it you cant have it!
808	I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.	Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget.	There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and	Paris?	We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .	Keep talking.	Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can!	I love you!
809	Yes!	I win again!	Ha-ha!	Thats like 500 bucks you owe me!	Whoo-ho-hoo!	$500 that is a loooot of electricity!	Whoo-ho-ho!	I gotta buy some food.	Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.	You serious?	Oh yes!	Okay, get ready to owe me!	Okay.	Okay, here we go. Ready?	No! No! No! Noone can beat me.	See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.

My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.	Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.	4:00 A.M.	So, can I get some candy?	I am sorry, but some of us have to	Umm, listen I am sorry, but Ill put some out first thing in the morning.	Well okay, Ill swing by later. Do you live in this building?	Um-hmm.	Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you!	Mm! Night Gar!
811	Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered!	Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting.	You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork?	So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done for the day.	Well have we finished the scene?	Yeah! Youyou were wonderful.	As were you.	So I got your car, its right outside.	Oh, thank you. Youre welcome.	No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.	Is that my ass?
812	What about these? These look the same?	Definitely!	Not as each other!	Oh, then no.	Hey!	Hi!	You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.	Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.

Mm-Hm
813	I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that picture.	Oh my God! Look at this!	Okay, but there	I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!	I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.	And did you?!	No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.	But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.	Oh my God.	Hello darling.	Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
814	Okay, is everybody clear? Were gonna pick it upand move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? Were gonna	Ross, I really dont think	Lift!! And slide!	Okay, here we go.	All right everyone, lift!  And slide!!
815	All right Carl, were next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?	Another	Thats right! And what are you not gonna do?	Well, Im not gonna talk because
816	I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but	Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand.	I-I am so sorry, Ill go.	Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.	Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.
817	I found my identical hand twin!	Ohh, you are	No!	But she just came up here!	That was Joey!	I wonder where she is. That is so weird.	Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.	Would you stop that!	Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?	She didn't feel anything for him.	She loves you!	Really?	Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.	Okay.	Good.  I should really start wearing hats!
818	I mean, why should I let them meet him?	I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.	I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.	Listen.	As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.	I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.	I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.	Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
819	No-no-no-no.  Hey!	Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.	Hey sweetie.	Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?	I cant tell you. Its a secret.	Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.	Awww.  But still no.	No Im serious, we should tell each other	Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at	Oh no-no, I cant do that.	If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said.	Okay.	Okay.	So, Ross and I are going to	Oh my God.

822	Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.	Okay, shoot.	Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.	I didn't get it?	No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.	Okay, what else?	Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'	Oh.	Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'

Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.	Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.	You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?	What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?	Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.	What are you saying I should do?	I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.	Thank you, Monica.	Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.	Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.

Yeah, but, there were no suds.	So?	Well, you know, no suds, no save.	No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.	Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.	Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.

I mean.	if you dont get that...	No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time.	And Im happy for ya, but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!	Okay, I dont know what to do anymore.	Well neither do I!
832	Hey!	Im sorry Im late, did I miss anything?	Joey stuffing 15	15?  Your personal best! (Ross takes an	Where were you?	Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.	Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?	Oh, which museum?	No, answer his.	Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.	She was totally at my mercy.	Were you so late because you were burring this woman?	No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.	She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.	How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany.	Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now?
833	No, there is no way! It can	Why is your family	He cannot play at our wedding!	I mean everyone will leave!	I mean come on, that is just noise!	Its not even a song!	If you listen very carefully, I think its
834	Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!	So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story?	Oh, yeah, sure.	I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are they, where are they?	Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.	Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?	Yeah.	You see, now, I would date this girl.	Shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.	I mean, thats got to come in handy	Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?	I dont know.	Me neither.	Rachel.	What?!	I dont know.  Me neither.
835	Look, I wanted to tell Im-Im sorry you lost.	Listen, Ive got a secret for ya. I let him win.	Is that a secret or a lie.	No, I let him winRoss!	Yeah?	Would you tell her I let you win please?	Oh. Yeah.  Uh Chandler	I am strong! Ill show you!	Chandler please!	Oh whats the matter? Are you scared?	Lets go big bunny!	Okay. 123Go!   Im gonna kill myself!
836	Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?	Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten	Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.	Also an island.	Hey, what time is it?	2:17.	Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?	Are you serious?!	Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.	Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!	Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!	Hey, you guys	Hey!
837	Who is it?	Its Phoebe! Phoebe!	Hey!
838	Oh God. So-so youre making porn movies.
839	No Im not.	Youre making one right now!	And-	Yeah, can I help you with something?	Look, Im talking right now! Youreyou mean her.	Yknow, twin stuff is always a real big seller.	What?!	Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.	No!!	And stop using my name!	And shame on you!	And shame on all of you!	Youre disgusting!	Especially you  with that!
840	Hey!	Hi Pheebs!	Are you moving out?	No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.	Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?	Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.	Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,	Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...	Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.	One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.	Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!	Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies	All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.	Which proves that I never lie.	I guess you don't.	Paolo made a pass at me.
841	Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.	Im not freaking out.	Why would I be freaking out?	A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.	Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!	I mean, whats the harm in that?	Right here!	Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel	Phoebe and Rachel!	So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!	It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.	Okay.	Really?	Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready	I know! I know.	Okay.	Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you.	Hey, did she buy it?	Totally.	So did Heldi show you the place?	Yeah, its beautiful.	I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!	I know.
842	Okay look, I have an idea.	Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.	And then whoever does gets the phone.	All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.	Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.	Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.	Did I use that already today? Im sorry.	Joe.	Oh, I win! Hes got	So you dont know thats	His new girlfriend!
843	I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?	I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.	Shes saving the rest for her divorce.	And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to	Well what happened at dinner?	My parents spent the money for our wedding!	My God! What did you order?!	Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!	Honey, its gonna be okay.	No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!	No, yknow what?	Its gonna be okay.	I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast.	Yknow?	And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
844	Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here.	Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.	Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.	I will sit with you Dr. Geller.	Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.	Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.	Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!"	Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.	Im Ross!	Im divorced, and I have a kid!	Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!	Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.	All right, there you go!	Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!	Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear.	Okay, good-good for you.	Im Rhonda,  and these arent real!	Wow, Rhonda.	Im Scott.	Yeah, okay, Scott!	And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
845	So thanks for the warm welcome.	Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.	I hope you do too.	Now, lets go out there and get em!	And remember, there is no I in team.	Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody	You! Chuckles! Whats your name?	Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah...	No-no, I heard what you said, funny.	I like funny.	This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun.	Good to have you aboard Bing!
846	Yeah. You won't be able to take it.	So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?	They're gonna call her Chandler.	That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?	Works on you.
847	Oh, that is so sweet.	No, no, ok, you hang up.	Ok, ok, one, two, three.	Well you didn't hang up either.	She didn't hang up either...	Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y
848	Ross, hi, it's Rachel.	I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your	Rach, I got a message from you.	Oh my God.	Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the.	You're over me?	Ohhhhhhhh God.	Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?	Ohh, ohh.	When, when were you... under me?	Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.	OK, I need to lie down.
849	Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!	Really? That's great!	I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her	(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of	Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,	Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.	Ben is way cuter than that kid.	I mean look at him, look at you,	That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?	Joey, you look nothing like Ben.	I look more like him than you do!	Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
850	That really was some of your best work.	Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.	I have to be up in seven minutes.	Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes	Really?!	Do you wanna?	Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
851	Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.	Boyfriend?	No.	Im Joey.	Kristen.	Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?	Kristen.	Got it!  So	So uh, do you live around here?	Yeah!	Yeah!	Right down there.	Hey listen.. let me give you a little tip.	Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.	Ill remember that.	Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?	Oh I, I have plans tonight.	But how about tomorrow?	Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?	You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes.	Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one.
852	Hey.	Listen, um...	I'm sorry.	: Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'	That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!	Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.	If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?	Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.	You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
853	By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.	Oh, hello liar.	Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.	I couldve been killed I hope you know!	I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were	Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.	Phoebe.	What?!  What the hell?!	All right, yknow what?	If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.	What?! Why?!	Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar	All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.	Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.	Okay Ross!  Please dont die!
854	How could you have kept all of this from me?	I was going to tell you, but	But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!	Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?	Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.	No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.
855	Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!	Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?	Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.	Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?	You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.	Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.	Why did you take the shower curtain down?	That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.
856	Hi.	Hey man, how did the audition go?	Estelle said I didn't get it.	What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!	Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
857	No!	For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.	No, from now on, Im staying in one place.	Right here.	Well, its getting late.	Yeah, were gonna go.	Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?	Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.	Yeah, its a very large plane.	Thats cool.	But, well stay here with you.	Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.
858	Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.	Theyre not a couple!	Oh-okay, I get the game now.	Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?	Oh yeah!	Well okay, so then youre fine.	The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.	Okay?	So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.	Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.	Really?	Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?	No.	Noooo!!
859	Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!	Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.	Wait a second! So, whats new with you?	Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.
860	And your breasts! Hmm!!!	Okay.	Umm look, youre coming on a little strong.	But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.	So, why dont we just start over okay?	And you can just tell me about yourself.	All right.	Okay.	I write erotic novels, for children.	What?!	Theyre wildly unpopular.	Oh my God!	Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.	Wow! You do?	Yeah,  a Pretty Huge	All right.
861	So, uh, how's she doing?	The doctor says it's a matter of hours.	How-how are you, Mom?	Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?	What?	What's different?	Nothing.	Oh, maybe that's it.	She is unbelievable, our mother is...	Okay, relax, relax.	We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.	Oh God!	The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.	Oh!	...Yeah, they were gross.	Oh, you know what I loved?	Her Sweet 'n' Los.	How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.	Not just restaurants, from our house.
862	Maybe.	You can't!	Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.	In the hall.
863	Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.	But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.	Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.	Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.	That's a good one!	Hey, Joe.	Dad, Ronni's here.	Huh?
864	So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal.	Anything at all.	But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.	Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.	Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!
865	Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.	Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi!	Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?	Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A	Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.	So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?	Okay, youre fine.
866	Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!	Youll see.	I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.	Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles	And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.	But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time.	Really, its fine, whatever you want.	Its perfect.	And, I dont know, if it starts to rain	Well then well get wet.	Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
867	Coming.	I have a bone to pick with you.	Uh-oh.	Yes! Ben learned a little trick.	Oh yeah? Did he pull the old	Thats right! Thats right!	Oh that.	Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!
868	Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!	Okay.	And if it were true, how	Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
869	Mark's a genius!	Why?! How?! How is he a genius?	Look, don't you see what's happening here.	Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.	Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.	What am I going to do?	Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.	All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.	I don't know you guys.	All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.	And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'	And before you know it, she's with him.	And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'	And he'll be all, 'Yes!'	And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'	And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'	And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'	He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
870	This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.	Great. Great.	Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud.	Ill be there.	Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.	Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!	Okay! Well need a six-pack of	Hey guys, what are you doing?
871	Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.	Oh, come on!	Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.	Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.	Well, Chandler will be there for you too.	I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there.	And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.	What do ya say? What do ya say?	Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.	But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.	I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!
872	What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.	I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!	Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...	What's that supposed to mean?	Nothing! It's an expression.	No it's not.	Don't listen to your mother.	You're independent, and you always have been!	Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!	And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
873	PBS Telethon.	Hi Joey.	Hey Pheebs!	I	$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what	Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
874	What kind of problem?	Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!	Oh my God!	Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!	Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.	I don't wanna give up the bag.	I don't have to give up the bag!	Do I Rach?	Oh, you think I should give up the bag!	Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it	I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.	I can't believe I'm hearing this!	Wait a minute!	Wait a minute!	I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.	Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
875	I think you'll find this room more to your liking.	Okay, great.	They say he's only got half a tank left.	Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!	We're switching rooms again.	What? Why?	This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.	Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.	Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?	Uh-huh.	Chandler!
876	Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!	Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!	Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
877	Hey!	Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming.	Oh, I wouldnt miss this.	Well, Im very glad youre here.	Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!
878	Hey!	Hey-hey.	So are guys doing okay?	Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
879	Do you have a minute?	Well yeah, sure, whats up?	I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
880	Oh really?!	Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?	Oh, did you not want people to know that?
881	But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.
882	Whys that?
883	I dont think I should say.	Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.	Okay.	Kay.	Well	Yeah.	Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.	Yeah, shes gay.
884	Here you go.	Great! All right, so Ill call you later.	Great!	Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?	That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.	Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.	No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.	What?	Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!	Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!	Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?	Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.	What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.	Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.	But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.	You got all that from the back of her head?	All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.	Whos Elaine?
885	Can you people not see me?!	So, will you talk to him?	I dont know Rach.	Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free	One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
886	Hey!	Hi!	Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?	We need a porn break.	We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.	Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?	Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.	Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.	Hey!	Hi!	Well, what-what cha got there?	Oh this, well Im glad you asked.	Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?	Ahh!	Now, I know what youre thinking	Pregnant Woman Slays Four?	Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?	No!	Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.	No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.	Whats the second part of your plan?
887	Yes thats right.	Why?	I tired attacking two women, did not work.	What?!	No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.	In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.	Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!	Oh, no!	No-no!	No, I tired!	But I couldnt.	Thats why Im here.	Maybe we could attack them together?	That-thats a no.
888	What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!	Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!	I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!	All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.	No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.	No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.	I like that.	Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.	Huh?	One swift kick and hell back off.	All right, bad ankle, got it!	And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.	Yeah.	And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup.	Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!	And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp.	But-but, Liams on my team.	I dont care! You just get him!	Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!	The Red Ross! Okay.
889	Oh!  Oh by the way?	Uh-hmm.	James Brolin?	Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay.	Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.	Really?!
890	Hello?	Hello, is Ross there?	Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?	Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.	Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!
891	Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!	Oh!  Shes growing inside you.	Whoa!!	Oh!	Wow that was a big one.	I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.	Oh hey you guys!
892	Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going?	I have a job interview I have to get ready for.	I thought you already have a job.	And people say you dont pay attention.	No, this is a much better job.	Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.	Wow! How do you know how to do that?!	Thats what I do now.	Hey Joey, come taste this.	What is it?	Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge!	You cooked him?	No.	He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.	Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!	"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."	The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?
893	So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?	No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.	Were never gonna find anybody.	Well then let me do it!	Joe	No-no-no!	Look, Ive been thinking about it.	Im an actor right?	So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.	I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts!	Everyone knows Im an ass man!	That is true.	Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.	Itll be me!	And I swear Ill do a really good job.	Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.	It might be kinda cool.	So I can do it?
894	Ah-ha! Too cocky!
895	I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.	Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place.	What the hell is that?	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?	You said there was a gas leak in here.	Well why dont you use your key?	Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.	If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.	Come on!	Hurry up.	Oh! We could have done that.
896	Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.	Oh, Im so sorry.	Um, and maybe Im wrong!	I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.	You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?	Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
897	Oh, but its made her so happy.	Little girl misses her cat.	Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.	Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.	Yeah.	Thank you.	I	He is right, isnt he?	Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.	You think?	Oh-no, hes right.
898	Seven hundred bucks!	Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?	Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.	Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?	What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
899	Oh.	Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
900	Me too.	Although this city is my home, so.	So thats dumb what I said, dont tell him I said that.	Umm, you make something up.	Nice,  thank you.	This is me.	Here.	Your eyes are very pretty.	Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!	He would like to kiss you.	Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now.	No-no-no-no!!	Not him, you dont!	Well the moments over.	Oh.	Oy!
901	Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?	Id really prefer a mountain bike.	Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.	Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.	Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.	Oh, you want something serious.	Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.	Those are dead serious.	All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever.	No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant.	Why not?!	Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...	What is the thing?	Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.	What?	They were in his office.	Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me.
902	Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn how to walk.	Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.	Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?	How are you feeling?	You are	I really wish that you wouldnt.	Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?	Then we can put you in bed, okay?	Just smile and dont talk to	Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?	Pheebs!!	Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!	Speech! Come on Monica!	Come on!	Come on! Speech!	Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second!	Oh-ho, I think its nice.
903	Well you have to because maybe its stupid.	Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.	Oh crap!
904	All right.	The super couldnt figure out what it did.	A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did.	Ive had seven pretty serious shocks.	I officially give up.	Thank God.	I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.	See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
905	Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?	He doesn't have anyone.	Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.	I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.	Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!	Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.	You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.	Y'know, we don't have to watch this.	No way, forget it.	C'mon, she's your mom!	Exactly.	Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!	I love her books!	I cannot get on a plane without one!	I mean, this is so cool!	Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'	C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
906	Thank you.	And a nice hot cider for Monica.	Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?	Yeah?	Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?	Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!
907	Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?	You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!	Yeah I can, it worked real well.	No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.	I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.	Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!	What?!	Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.	Who are you talking too?	Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.	I am	You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!	I-I'm sorry! Sorry.	Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
908	Shh! Get me out of here.	Oh.	Ross!	What?	Come here, check this out!	What? Is it the comet?	No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here.	Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!	Yknow, theres	Show me where?	Right-right up here.	Joey wheres the pipe that was holding the door open?	I dont know!   Yeah, I do.	Joey!	What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid	Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!	Oh no! No! No!
909	Wow! This place is incredible!  Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!	Hi!	Hi!	Im Trudie.	Uh-huh.	You must be Bens mum.	Why else would I be here?	Do sit down.	Yeah.
910	Hi.. how was the game?	Well..	WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!	Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?	Alan.	He was unbelievable.	He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...	I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.	Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..	Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..	What?	..I dunno, a little too Alan?	Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.	Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.	I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
911	Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade,	Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?	What the hell!	Okay.	All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?	Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
912	My God!	These pants are burning up!	Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!	What is she trying to kill me?	It's like a volcano in here!	Are you hot?	Okay, it must just be me then.	That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
913	You're driving me crazy with that!	Okay, I'll stop.	Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!	Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.	You wanna play?	Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.	And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.	Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.	All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?	I'm intrigued.	All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.	Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.	Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.	Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?	Uh yeah, right here.
914	Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?	What's that?	Weeeell, it's rum, and-
915	I'm sure they'll be here soon.	Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.	Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.	You are really frightening me.	Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?	All right, ten centimeters, here we go.	All right, honey, time to start pushing.	But they're not here yet!	I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.	Oh, god.
916	Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.	Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.	Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you.	And I mean-Im having a lot of fun.	Okay.	I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun.	Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?	So where-where is it going?	Ah!	Thats-thats the real question.	And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun.	Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.	No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou	Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?
917	Yknow what?	I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.	I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .	No?	Really?	They taste so good.
918	Drum roll.	Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?	Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.	All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.	Youre actually going through with this?	Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.	Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.	You got problems because of you!	Not your name!	All right, this has got to stop!	Chandler is a great name!	In factyes,  Im, Im sorry.	I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler.
919	Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!	It was.
920	Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me.	Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?	No.	Whoa. That was really good.	Thanks, any suggestions?
921	You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!	Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and	You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!	Well I was just so excited to see you.	Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.	No-no its not!	I dont want to lose you!	Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird.	So I guess this is it.	Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.	Yeah, so do you.
922	Hey!	Hi.	So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?	Manhattan does not have enough stores.	Well,	You can?	Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.	Um-hmm.	And a small piece of chocolate.
923	Okay.	Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship	I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!	Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.	Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.	I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!	Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?	No! No! Not, Paris.	Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?	Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!	When?	I dont know exactly.	Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.	But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
924	Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!	Great! Go get him.	Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.	Hes not really my type.	No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.	But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.	You do attract some stinkers.
925	Chandler.	Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a	Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.	Oh, listen.	If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.	Really.	Nothing at all.	Really.	Nothing.
926	Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?	Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?	No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.	Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?	No, no, I keep trying, yknow?	I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."	He may think Im sick.	Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!	Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.	Thats it.	Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?	Pretty much.	All right.	Hey Monica!	Hi!	Hey man, you feeling any better?	Joey, we have something to tell you.	Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
927	Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.	What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.	Really?!	Yeah!	Oh my God!Eh! Well
928	You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.	Hes gonna go up to the counter with	Yeah.	I missed this.	Me too.	So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
929	Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!	Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.	We will.	Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.	No Mon,	Every year.
930	Hey! Ross!	Die Hard	Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?	Whatd you rent?	Die Hard 2	Joey, this is	Oh, well we watch it a second time and its	Joey, we	And?	And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!	Die Hard	Dude, you didnt say	Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.	Well, John McClane had plans!	No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.	What are you talking about? Bitch.
931	I know you botched that operation on purpose.	I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.	I don't care if you    are my brother.
932	Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!	Stop going through my stuff !	Hey!	Hey!	I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.	No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.	Please, what about you and Chandler?	That's different! I was drunk and stupid!	Well hello !	What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?	I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!	Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.	I'm gonna do it.	And I can't stop you.	No.	Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?	I'm smarter than
933	Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.	Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.	Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.	Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.	Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.	No.	No, thank you.	You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.	Id love an ice water.	You got it.	Joey, what are you doing?	Just being friendly.	Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.	Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?	Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.	Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.	Joey, do you work here?	No.	Hey, waiter.	Yeah?
934	Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.	Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.	Im calling for Monica Geller.	I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available	This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!
935	Thank you.	Thanks.	I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!	Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am	This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.	So go fix it!	Go find Chandler!	He's probably up in your room!	Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.	Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!	Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!	Anybody lose this?	Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!	Hmm.
936	Do you remember where the duck food is?	Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?	Because Im going to London.	What?! What do you mean youre going to London?	Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.	Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back.	IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!	Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.	But I have to tell him how I feel!	He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.	Thats not why youre going!	Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.	Forget that British chippy."	OhhDo you think he will?!	No!	Because hes in love with the British chippy!	Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!	Yknow, its too late!	You missed youre chance!	Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.	Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I do."	I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.
937	So is everybody here?	I got here a little early myself.	Let us begin.	Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.	Here.	Here.	Now as for the hydrosaurs
938	Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.	Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.	So, do you think you can forgive me?	Great.	Thanks.	Okay, bye.	Hello, Jennifer?	Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?	Oh, shes not home huh?	Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
939	Hey!	Hi.	Are you all right?	Uhh… I think I just got engaged.	Oh my God! He did it?	Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?	Are you kidding?	I’m like the one who talked him into it.	I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.	And you really think this is a good idea?	I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.	I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.	Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.	Really?! Even Ross?	Especially Ross!	Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later.	Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back.	There he goes, your fiancée.	I guess so.	Although he does play with himself in his sleep.	I can’t say that I’m surprised.
940	Oh, that is so unfortunate.	What?	Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.	Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.	You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.	Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye.	Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.	Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.	I think on some levels she already knows.
941	Night Mon. Night Julio.	Adiós.	Look Julio, someone left their book here.	Ah actually, that is mine.	Oh yeah, what are you reading?	Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?	Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?	I thought I would, but the translation's no good.	Your a poet and don't know it.	Actually I ah, I am a poet.	Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?	Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.	Mine?  Right here?	I can write an epic poem about this lip.	How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
942	Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.	What?	I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.	What?	Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?	Are we really in Montreal?!	Yes we are. So, coffee?	Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?	Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
943	Okay, heres batch 22.	Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.	This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.	Lets give it a shot.	Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?	No, just a Friday night.
944	Would she?	Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
945	Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.	I know honey, Im sorry.	Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.	Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!	Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....	I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.	Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?	Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....	Its not funny, this is actually my job.	Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.	Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.	And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.	Ah, just one other thing.	Yes?!	I ah, I work at	Do you want my pickle?
946	Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?	Why?	Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.	Oh my God.	Phoebe.	Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.	Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.	He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.	We should do something. Whistle.	We are not going to whistle.	Come on, do it.	No!	Do it!	No!	Do it do it do it!	Woo-woo!	I can't believe you did that!
947	Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.	Still?	I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.	I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.	Either eat it, or be in it.	Spoon?  So, what do you think?	Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.	Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. theres a new class comin in.	Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?	I can.	Okay, go ahead.	Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.	Thats very good, whats your name?	Monica.	Monica, you go to the head of the class.	Okay.
948	And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.	But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.	Human spleeeen.	Olé!	What are you doing here!	Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!	Great!	Yeah!	It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!	Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".	Listen Phoebe...	Yeah.	You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...	But what?	This is kind of a classy place.	Ok, say no more.
949	I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.	Well, I've brought some books. We could read.	Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.	Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!	I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention	Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?	We can't. We're not pharmacists!	I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...	Kate Miller?	Kate Miller it is.	And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.	In that case should I make sure it's on real good?	Thank you.
950	Oh my God!	We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.	This year was supposed to be great!	But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!	No. No, you're not a loser.	Look at me!	Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!	Oh, be-because of the leather pants.	See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.	That really is something.. that's really cool.	Howdy partner!	Maybe I should get another pair!	Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.	I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.	I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.	I would make a good cowboy.	Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.	Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
951	No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!	Oh yeah!
952	Great nap.	It really was.	Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.	So, lets talk about women. Im sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.	Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?"	Oh, please!	Hey, how you doin?
953	Hey Mikey	Hey P	What are you doing?	Setting rattraps	To kill Bob??	No, no, to test his neck strength.	No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!	I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.	Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.	I'll find Bob, I'll get him.	Bob?	Bob!	Robert!	Oh wait, I think I hear him.	Oh - Oh my god!	Bob    had babies!	Bob's a mom!	Better think of a new name for him.	I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.	I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...	Oh my god, we killed Bob!	Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.	Suzie
954	Hmmm, soup!	Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?	Oh yeah, no problem.	Thanks.	Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.	Joey!
955	What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!	Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!	So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.	I said, "No!"	Which puts	Great. So the ball is in his court?	Ball? There is no ball.
956	Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?	Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.	What?! Why?!	Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and	Oh great! That	Do-do you, do you have brothers?	No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.	Are you close with them?	No-no, they're not very nice people.	Okay, listen, I really like you.	Okay?	I think this can go somewhere.	So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?	Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of	Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!	What?	Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
957	Its over.	Oh, was it awful?
958	Well, it was loong.
959	I didnt even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head.	Anyway, she didnt want to stay.	I called a cab. she just left.	I wrote you a letter.	Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.	Its just some things Ive been thinking about.	Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.	Okay.  Wow, its-its 5:30 in the morning.  So, Id better get cracking on this baby.	Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done.	Okay, Ill be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
960	The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!	Well, you said that we except the	All right, that Ill retract.	But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it.	Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!	You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.	Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.	Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?	Lebanon.	Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.	How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
961	Okay, then what happened?	Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!	Hey Pheebs, what's going on?	Nothing!   This is not over!	No! No! No!	What?!	I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks!	All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?	Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.	Really?	Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.	Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.	That's okay, Joe.	All right, let's go Pheebs.	Oh God!
962	That was amazing.	I know.	Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?	We may have just started a family.	Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.	And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
963	Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!	I knew it!	I knew it!	I always knew she liked him!	Y'know, shed say no, but here we are!	Right?	We just broke up, first thing she does!	You didnt just break up.	Hey, its been like three weeks!	You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
964	Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?	Oh yeah!	Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily.	Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes.	I made a promise that--Oh hey!	What?	You're nose is bleeding!	Oh God.	No!	Oh not again!	This-this happened when my grandfather died.	It's ugh!	Sorry.	Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?	Umm	Sorry. Sorry.	Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.	Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
965	Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!	Hello, Chip.	Hey, Rach! How ya doin?	Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at	So ah, Monica ready yet?	Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch?	Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
966	Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all the time.	How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?	Hes talking to the baby.	Ohh!	Okay!	Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."	Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later.	Okay.
967	Oh my, oh my God!	Aw, its unbelievable!	Wow!	She is kicking so much!	Oh, shes like ummohwhos that kind of annoying girl soccer player?	Mia Hamm?	Mia Hamm!	Oh thats amazing.	Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!	Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
968	Okay, what do you guys think?	Dude!	I have never known love like this.	You really like it?	Dude! How-how did you write this?	I stole Monicas and changed the name.	You cant	If he goes first he can!
969	Yeah!	Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, yknow?	Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.	Oh wow thats a great idea! And	Here you go.	Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.	Here you go.
970	Yknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI dont get Chandler.
971	Yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get all upset.	All the time?	All the time!
972	Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog.	Im all done.	Thank God.	I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.	Oh right.	Right.	Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried?	Were probably too old to do that now.	Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles.	Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.	It took you that long to figure it out, huh?	Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
973	Relax every muscle in your body.	Listen to the plinky-plunky music.	Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.	Okay, tell me your happy place.	Richard's living room, drinking wine.	All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!	I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.	Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.	Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.	All right, I'll try not to.	Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....	Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?	All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....	I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.	All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.	Okay.	Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.	And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....	Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
974	OK sweetie, I'll see you later.	See you later Rach.
975	Bye-bye Julie.	Hey.	Hey.	Hey, c'mon, cut it out.	Hey?	What?	Can I ask you somethin'?
976	Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.	Ok.	Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?	What's up?	F.Y.I..	I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.	Her name is Stephanie... something.	She's supposed to be very good.	But what about Phoebe?	Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.	Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.	Uh...	Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
977	Ahh, no.	Oh.	Are you jealous?	Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.	I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?	You are totally jealous.	I'm not jealous.	All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.	And y'know, and um, I...	Honey, I love you too.	Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.	What?	Huh.	Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.	Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
978	I cant believe you came back.	Dont say anything.	I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.	I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.	Rachel! Rachel!	What?	You missed the exit!	Oh, sorry.	My God, what were you thinking about?	Um,  Barry.	Awwwww
979	I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!	Dude!	And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.	God!	All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!	Well actually, Ross doesn't.	Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
980	Dear Mary-Angela.	Hi.	How?s it going.	This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.	What the hell?s a matter with you?	How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?	Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba.	All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person.	At least you know her name.	You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.	What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?	Where in Cuba?
981	Hey.	You uh, you may have been right about Jill.	Oh! I knew it! What happened?	Umm, she kissed me.	What?! You kissed!
982	All right.	Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?	A two and a five.	Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!	Really?!	Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got?	A four and a nine.	Youre kidding right?	No. Why?	Well thats a full cup!	Damn! I am good at Cups!
983	What? Why? Where are you?	Im still on the set!	Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!	I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.	Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.	No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.	Ugh! Joey, I have to go.	Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
984	Oh hey Joey! What's up?	I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?	Yeah, I've been around.	Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?	Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.	Great! Problem solved!
985	Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.	All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.	Why?	Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.	Bastard!
986	You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!	All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!	Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.	Oh, I can't believe it!	I mean I think it's great!	For him.	She might be able to do better.	Hey guys!	Joey! Come here! Come here!	Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.	You mean how they're friends and nothing more?	No. Joey, she	Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?	Yes, but y'know what?	It doesn't matter who knows what.	Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!	Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
987	It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
988	Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.	You really think it would be that different?	How could it not be?	I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.	And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a	Well, things change.	I dont want them to move to a	Itll be okay Joe.
989	Its still there!	Mrs. Braverman must be out.	She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.	By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.	No that could kill her.	Well, we dont want that.	No, so were protecting her.	But we should take it.	But we should move quick.	Why?	Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.	Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
990	Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?	Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.	Well, you're gonna.	I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...	Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?	Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.	And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?	Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...	Hey, you're not him.	You're you.	When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?	No.	No.	You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.	Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!	And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."	You really think so?	Yeah. I really do.	Thanks, Chandler.	Get off!
991	Hi.	Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?	When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?	And the cream?	Cheese makes me thirsty.	Okay. Lets move on.	All right.	Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?	Oh no!	I dont know anything about cooking.	I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.	Well, hats off to the chef.	I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?	The chef!	Thats right.
992	Hey, Pheebs.	Hey.	How's it going?	Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.	So what's going on?	Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.	I dunno, there's just something about...	Basically we just feel that he's...	We hate that guy.	Yeah. Hate him.	We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.	Uh-huh.	Okay.	Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?	...No, we hate him.	We're sorry.
993	Hey!	Hey!	What are you doing?	Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
994	Yes that was mine.	Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.	Yes that would have made more sense.	Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!	All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.	And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.	Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?
995	Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?	Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
996	She said what?	She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."	Postpone it?	Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?	Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?	This isnt right.	I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.	I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?	Dont you point your pants at me!	We have no choice!	Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?	This is our wedding Im talking about.	The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.	So what are you saying? Its now or never?	No. Im saying its now.	Or?	Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!	Its not the pants.	Its you that is backwards.	And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!	No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please
997	Hi, honey.	See you later.	What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!	Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!	Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.	Oh no!	I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available	Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!

1001	What?	I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.	All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.	It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.	If it's not you, this is a horrible story.	Fortunately, it is me.	And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.	Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.	Y'know, someplace nice.	Yeah, someplace nice.	Yeah!	How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
1002	So, what do you think?	I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.	I know!	So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?	Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!	Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
1003	Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.	Gotcha.	This place is really my Grandmothers.	I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.	So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR.	So are you thirsty?	Oh, you bet I am!	Okay, heres your penis!
1004	Ohh, okay.	Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.	Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.
1005	Hey, ready for dinner?	Ooh, absolutely!	Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?	Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.	How about Mama Lisettie's?	Enh. Sure!	I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.	Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!	Thatthis milk is mine.	I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.	Okay, let's go!	Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the	But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.	Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!	Okay, stop!	Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?	Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?	Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.	Thank you.	Go!	Go!	Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
1006	No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!	No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!	I know. Im sorry.	All right fine! This looks like so much fun.	Yeah.	God, what a mess.
1007	Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.	Well, I lost.	Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.	Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.	Hey! Howd the interview go?	Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.	Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.	Thats not how that was supposed to come out.	This is the worst Christmas ever.	Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.	I cant!	Its too late!	Terry already hired that girl over there.	Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.	Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.	That word was swans.
1008	What do we got there?	A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!	You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.	It's all right.	It's all right.	You don't have to explain.	This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.	You're our third call tonight.	Really?	Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
1009	I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.	No, you were right. I don't have a plan.	Thank God. Food.	Phoebe?	What?	Do you have a plan?	I don't even have a 'pl'.	No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.	Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'	Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?	Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?	And-and a power tie?	Oh God.	Are you nuts?!

Oh no, I'm fully qualified to	Shh!	Doogie, shh!	Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon?	Huh?	Go!	Go little boy, go!	Oh cool! You made him cry!

No. But its okay, Ill just put out pickles or something.	Ross, thank God.	Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?	I ate a bug.	Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up.	Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.	Oh, now you want a favour?	Yes, please.	Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?	Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.	No, Im not gonna pick them up.	Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk.	So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.	No, Rachel doesnt want me to....	Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.	Yeah, youre right.
1017	God, I feel so guilty about Ross.	Oh, I know.	I kinda feel like it's my fault.	Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.	Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!	Well, I think it's very brave what you said.	All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.	Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?	Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.	Okay, I admit it!	I love this coat!	Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!	Remember Phil Huntley?	He was fine!
1018	So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man!	Oh no	Id better go. (She goes and sits down in the	Ross Im so sorry. Okay.

Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.	Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the	I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.	Is this because of the burrito thing?	You need to give him money.	Give him money? It was a joke!	No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.	Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.	You've got to be smooth about it.	Hey, I can be smooth.	Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.	Of course, sir.	Okay.
1020	Id better get back to my desk.	Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation.	My what?	Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.	But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.	Are you serious?	No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
1021	I can blow dry it.	I can put gel on it.	It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.	Its so annoying.	Does it bug you?	You bug me.	Is there any chance you didnt see that?

Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn!	Hey-hey, yknow what?	Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.	Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.	You got porn!
1023	Well, I feel like a snack!	Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.	Oh no thanks. I dont like	What?!	Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.	Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.	You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!	How did you know about that?!
1024	Hi!	Hi!	Come in.	Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and	Great!	Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match.	Okay, so I made up a little test.

Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janines friends are dancers?!	And that theyre going to be drinking alot!	No, I did, but tell me again, because its so romantic.	Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster?	Joey!	Come on!	I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?	This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?	So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?	Oh I am!	Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!	Okay, fine!	Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?	Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it cant? Okay.
1026	You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?	Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.	Okay, now you're even cuter!!	Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.	What?	The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.	What are you talking about?	I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.	That's not possible!	Ow!	I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.	Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.	I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.	No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!	This bicep?	Well it's not flexed right now!
1027	It's Phoebe.	Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?	Umm, well, umm Grandma died.	No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.	No you didn't!	Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?	Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
1028	anyway, his name is Allan and weve been going out for three years.	He was my first client when I became a party planner.	He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.	Oh well.	And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.	Oh. Oh, thats great!
1029	Really? Like how?	Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so theyd put salt on their cereal.	Thats a good one.	Yeah? You like that one?	Yeah, youre funny.	Im funny?	Oh thank God!	Well hey, Ive got a ton of these!	Umm, oh hereDo you want a good one?	Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.	Right?	And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.	And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.	Can I do it to you?	Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?
1030	Chloe? Hi..	Is this about me taking your watch?	You took my watch?	Im sorry, I do that.	Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?	Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know.
1031	Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.	Yeah. That-that was the problem.	Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!	Bing! You got those numbers for me?
1032	So you still in touch with anyone from high school?	Umm. Well, theres Rachel, and umm, I think thats it. How bout you?	Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know.	I see Spindler a lot.	Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time.	Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire, J.T., Beardsley.	Is that all?	Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.	Ohh, how is he?	Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.	Isnt he an architect now?	Yeah, they still wear underwear.
1033	So the Porsche guy took his car back.	But you found the keys to his clothes?	No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.	And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes?
1034	Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!	Hey!	Oh! Its you.  Hi.
1035	What about me?! You-you just said I could!	Im not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!	I cant believe youre not picking me.	Hey, how can it	Im not even Im not even	Fine, yknow what, thats it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.	Yes!  Shame about you man.
1036	Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.	Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.	Wh-what?! Why?!	It's a money thing, we don't have any.	You're kidding right?	No.	What?!	It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.	Uh, hang out?! How long?	I don't know.	A week?	Maybe two?	The money will turn up!	People will always wanna invest in movies!	Hey, you're not rich are ya?	No!	Eh, worth a shot.  Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?	Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?	Yeah.	These got left for ya.	Thanks.   Congratulations on your big break.
1037	Rachel, do you have any muffins left?	Yeah, I forget which ones.	Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
1038	Hey.	Hey!	So how was Joan?	I broke up with her.	Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?	They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.	Come on, they were not that huge.	I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.	How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?	Hold it, hold it.	I gotta side with Chandler on this one.	When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.	It made me nuts.	You or me?	I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.	You guys are messing with me, right?	Yeah.	That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
